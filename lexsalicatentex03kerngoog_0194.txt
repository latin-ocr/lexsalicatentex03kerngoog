NOTES. TITT. XXXVII. XXXVIII.

frasitian, -sittan or -sitan, Ο. Fn's. vra-itta, O. H. G. furatrizzan,
A. S. sorsittan, to neglect, contemnere (sor A. S. see Schmid,
Gloss. i. v.; for O. H. G. Muspilli 33: “ Ni kitar parno nohhein
den pan fur-isizzan”). In the Fris. LL. 14, 6 we find the follow-
ing variations where the Latin text has “si quis hoc contempserit”;
ι’, “ Sawasa hir vrsitte end des riuchtes werne '² ς 2⁰, “ Sahuasa hir
vrsitte and n'ucktes werne'’; 3⁶, “ Hwaeso dat rius-lat uursz'tte ”3
4⁰, ‘⁶ Hwasa tha kininge werth for-iwemande jeftha sina weldega
boda.” By comparing these passages we leam that vrsitta n'ucht
is ‘⁶ contemnere legem‚” and hir vrsitta ‘⁸ to show opposition in
this matter,” and moreover that vrsitta and sor-iwema, to oppose,
in word or deed, are notions naturally passing into each other.
The causative form os frastttan, viz. frasatian, has produced D.
rich venetien, to resist3 hence the subst. venet, resistance. Being
a substantive venet, though belonging to the reflexive verb,
shows no distinctive mark os the reflexive. Praetically frast'ttha is
both ‘⁶ contempt, neglect,” and D. verset, resistance.

In the latter sense frasittha is a synonym of A. S. forsteal,
obsistentia, Ο. N. fyn‘rstassa, etc. ; cf. Tit. XXXII. A word
belonging to the family osfrastandan is discoverable in the Malb.
of 6 and 10 though blended, it would seem, with a reading frasatti-
tha, fmsattida. The latter is the exact counterpart‚ except the suffix,
of D. venet, in so far as the causative frasattian by itself is
‘⁶ opponere,” whereas the subst. implies the reflexive notion; in
English, it need not bc said, even the verb ‘⁸ to oppose ” is so to say
a middle voice without any distinctive mark. From fmstathian,
-stadzam ‘⁶ to bring into opposition,” might be formed, analo·
gously to frusattitha, a subst. frastatkitha, -da ; cs. O. H. G.
gastatida as to the suffix, and O. N. syn'rstaba as to the verb (¹).
A derivative from the intransitive frastandan, viz. frustanditha, al.
-stanthita amounts in point os fact to the same thing; cf. O. H. G.
firstanti‘da, wfflarstendt'da, and the like.

There is little doubt that frasittha, -sattitha, wrotham, and
-standitha were in common use and denoted the same thing,
namely: ‘⁸ opposition, in word or deed.” It may be a matter of
doubt only which term we should allot to each single Codex. For
7-9 we cannot but prefer fian'ttho ‚· in 10 frastathitlto must have
been intended 3 in 6 either srasattido or fiastatkido.

We have now to make out the purport and the sound os the first
word of the phrase in question. Suppose the term had been
omitted in the Lex, how should we fill up the blank Ρ In order to
solve this problem we must take into account the recurrence of the
same term in Tit. LXVI. There the delict, so styled, is committed
by one who resists the legal recovery of stolen cattle3 in the pre-
sent chapter the culprit is the owner of cattle lost. Consequently
the whole phrase can have but one meaning—opposition to the
legal authority, or contempt of the legal ordinances. Τ11ε first
word we require would be adequately represented by the Latin
auctoritas. The sound of the Frankish word, if we have to trust
the scribes, is something like ηιὶεία, mita, mittim'(a), the final o
being the sign of the genit. sing. fem. By dint of etymology, by
referring to O. Ν. metare, esteem, rank, dignity3 metuabr, metnu’br,
honour, respect, rank3 A. S. meotod, providence‚ fate, destiny;
Goth. mitan, to measure ; and by comparing Skr. mana, pramdrpa,
measure and authority, 1 might succeed, perhaPS, in making out a
not very weak case, but anything approaching a grammatical proof 1
for one am not able to produce. And any explanation wanting a

(¹) Fmattarha is formed like Ο. H. G. sezstb'a, restite, and the like.

grammatical basis is not worth being discussed, still less adopted.
Curiously enough wittha, O. H. G. vibilia, and wz'ttia', πσίέὶᾶ, Frank.
os Gl. L. 1042, witti, O. H. G. wizi would be perfectly intelligible,
and scarcely differ in meaning from Goth. witop, Ο. H. G. amboni,
missod, Frank. of the Ps. matut, wae'ttut, D. wet, law: for m’tian
and witdn, A. S. mtt'an and weotian, ordinare, constituere, cannot
be kept separate. thini would show an amplified form, like
Ο. N. vitna, to witness, attest3 vitm} witneSS, testimony3 cf. A. S.
witta = witsczpe = witness, testimonium. Calling to witness and
protesting being practically the same, witu‘ni would mean protest,
protestation; wittim‘o frasattitha, contempt of the protest. In
Tit. LXVI, where there is no question os a protest, not mittinio,
but the other more comprehensive term occurs.

To sum up the results: either the Salic Franks, alone among all
Teutons, treated a verb metan in the same manner as if it were
synonymous with παίωνι, or the scribes have replaced the Frank. w
by m. Cf. Tit. CVI.

ᾗ 187. Α draught-horse is called channauascho in 7, clummclm
in 9, cana-:asco in 8. Changarto, Ο. Fris. hang-rt, hengst, etc..
is intended. As to the fluctuating meaning of hengst 1 may refer
to Heyne in Grimm‘s D. W. i. v. hengst. As we do not know the
context of the original, we are unable to decide whether the
final o is the sign of the dative or os a weak mascul. in the nomina·
tive or merely additional. Another form with Umlaut is mengum,
in ξ 2 of10. As it stands at “caballus spado '' we gather that
hangast, hengist in common parlance meant a horse in general, just
as the Ο. Fris. hangst, hengst and Dan. hest, Swed. beist. 1116 the
term in paragraphs 1 and 3 should be identical, viz„ changikto with
a probable variety changosto. A further inserence from what has
just been remarked is that chance in 10 is a corrupted chau(gs)w.
The monstrous han-liam in 2 has arisen from hungis-tam, in which
um represents o according to the prevailing pronunciation of the
semi-Latin of the period. For amacha in 1, a codex which we
know to be partial to cockneyism, read hangastko ,· th is a cum-
brous spelling.

9 188. The would-be Latin waram’o is Μ. D. wrm, admissarius,
more or less corrupted in 0. H. G. reineo, reinna, etc. (a. Grafl', Spr.
Ι, 978). The word is properly an adjective, A. S. mane, lmcivus.
The same notion of ‘⁶ lascivus ” enters into another Frank. word
for ⁶⁴ admissarius,” namely, walden'do in ι, etc. Rae'do, probably
ride, is in the main M. D. nsider, “cuniculus admissarius; ” njiiig
ann “equire, coitum appetere3 dicitur de equis ” (Kil. i. v.).
Redo may be redo, which would agree with Ο. Η. G. reit in reit-
hano, gallus gallinaceus (Graff, Spr. 1, 958). Consequently, η’ᾰο,
redo and war-annio convey the same meaning “ a stallion.” usaue,
wald, a wood, a park, is to be taken in the sense of the O. N. vfflllr,
a paddock; hence walden'do may be rendered “ a stallion of the
stud.” In Ο. Η. G. glossar-ies there is a curious translation os
maht-os, a stud-horse, vis. ‘⁶ equus ferus 3⁸⁹ this looks as if it
originated from a word walthms, because walt is also “ a wood.”
In 2 read walderedo; in 6 waldram in 7-9 waldrrtho; in 10
waldm'do, -red0. .

ᾗ 189. For “waranio regis⁹⁹ 6 has selcha, 10 setheo, which are
both corrupt. Either O. H. G. seclo, schelo, admissarius, is in-
tended, or what is called in Latin sellaris or sellarius (sor which
cf. Ducange i. v.). In the latter alternative the true reading would
be seleche, from elza, 0. S. ehu, A. S. eoh, eh, Ο. Ν. jdr, and Ο. Ν.
