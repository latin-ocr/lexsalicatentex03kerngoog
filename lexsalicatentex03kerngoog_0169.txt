ἦ 67. Alfalchio in 1 contains salchio, a fem. subst..and the nom.
act. os a verb corresponding to Ο. Η. G. falgyizn, subtrahere;
givalgan, attrectare, usurpare (Graff, Spr. ΙΙΙ, 500). Al is appa-
rently connected with Ο. N. ali, used of ‘⁴ household ” anima15‚
e. g. alidjtr, a domestic animal (Oxf. Dict. i. v.). Since the other
codd. show the term theo, ‘⁶ a servant,” about the meaning of which
there can be no doubt, we may reasonably assume that al was one of
the words denoting ‘⁴ a domestic.” Alfalcbio may be rendered by
“ plagium domestici,” because we find in Tit. XXXIX derivatives
from the very verb falgz'an, viz. falclu’no, etc., rendered by “ pla-
giare.’' Now the sense attached to “ plagiare ” is expressed in the
Lex Emend., Tit. XXXIX, by the words ‘⁴ id est per circumven-
tionem de servitio domini sui abstraxerit.'’ Consequently, falcln'o
must have meant not only kidnapping, but also enticing, seduction.
Knowing this, we can understand how cod. 2 shows teoducco, read
theoducco, and t(h)eodocco, in one place rendered by “ furaverit,'' in
another by “prodederit,” read ‘⁴ perdiderit.” Πεο, where mas-
cul.‚is Goth. pius, etc. ; where fem. Goth. piari, O. S. thim, thiu,
etc. Ducco, docco, stands for ducjo, M. H. G. and N. H. G. tu‘cke,
fallacia, dolus; cf. duck in Grimm, D. W. ΙΙ, 1489. Theoducco
may be rendered “ enticing a domestic, a servant.” A Isalchio and
theoducco convey the same notion, and so far it is easily understood
why codd. 1 and 2 have different termS.

Slightly different is theos(theus)taxac(h)a in 7, 8, 9. Tbeos,
theus, is the genit. c. of the masc. sing„ Goth. piwaes. Taxacha has
been explained before. For teoxaca in 6, texeca in 5, we must
read theotexacha, theotexecka. In 10 the syllable thais superfluous;
the required theutexac(h)a appears in the same cod. in the next ᾇ.

ξ 68. Theubardi in 1, theophanio in 6, theobardO, etc., in 7-9 cannot
contain theu, a servant, because we see b alternating with ph, which
would be impossible if the letter were the initial ot a word. Hence
we must conclude that the term in question is either a compound
with theub, theoph, thies, or asubstantive derived from a verb corre-
sponding to A. S. Peqfian, furari. One would expect theubadi,
theophado, stem theobadia (cf. O. Fris, thiuvethe, thiuftlze, A. S.
peoffi, pjrfo), or theubandi, analogous to Ο. Fris. wat-ande, or
Ο. N. kveb‘andi, and the like. Yet we have no sufficient reason to
impugn the authority of the MSS. in this respect. If the word be
a derivative it must mean ‘⁴ theft’' or “stolen goodS.” In the
context it rather seems to be used as a term to express a fine of
600d., otherwise denoted by leudardz’, such as 10 has, This cir·
cumstance does not favour the supposition that theubardi simply
means ‘⁸ theft’' or ‘⁴ stolen goods ;’' much more natural would be
some term like A. S. peofgild, ·gyld, e. g. Aeth. 1. 1, 2. As leu-
dardi stands for leudwardi, theubardi may be a compound of
the-ub and wardi. Such a compound would exactly answer to
Peofgild,· cf. above, ᾗ 32.

ᾗ 69. By‘ ‘vassus (οι- puer) ad ministerium” is rendered a
Frank. 1ιόωὲ (εΙιόνοξ), i. e. Ο. Fris ΙιένοεΙι, M. H. G. hoerec,
N. H. G. Ιιόηζ, subditus; a serf. It is an adjective, and follows»,
even where it is used as a substantive, the declension of the adjec-
tiveS. Hence the strong accus, masc. is Mrogmw, hdrogan = N.
H. G. (einen) hb‘rzgen. It answers to the Latin accusative vassum
or puerum, in the text. The errors of the codd. are easily cor-
rected; for stt-ogau in 2 read chor-agan ,⁰ for thorogao in 3, horo-3
gauo in 4, read chor-agano, horogarw.

The corresponding fem. form is hbrogam', accus, Ιιόνοξαηία,
which is rendered “puellam de ministerio '' in ᾧ 7 of 6, where, os

TIT. X.

course, Ιι basto be added. For “horog aut” we ought to read
“ horogan aut.” The femin. suffix is the same as in Goth.
Saurini, a Syrian woman; Ο. H. G. wirtun, hospita; A. S. (e)nn,
(e)n, in peowen, serva, etc.

§ 70. In the same manner is derived ambahtam‘‚accus. ambahtan ia,
from a masc. *ambalat (stem ‘’gja = Goth. andbahteis) or *ambab-
tio = Ο. 8. ambahtio (stem ambabtjan). It may mean a haudmaid,
like O. N. amba‘tt, and alsoaworkwoman knowing some· ‘metien ”
From the context we gather that the latter 1s meant; cf, Tit. XIII.
Ambaht, A. S. ambeaht, amthht ombiht, embeht, Ο. 8. ambalat,
ammalzt, O. Fris. ombelzt, ombet, ambet, M. D. ambaclzt, ambocht,
ambt, N. D. ambacht,‚ambt, etc., occur in the Malberg m different
altered formS. Nearest to the original stands ambaotlwm‘a, read
ambahtonia, ambolztom'a in § 8 of 105 somewhat further off, ambi-
tam'a in 2, and ambotanea in 6. We shall find still more cor·
rupted forms in Tit. XIII.

ἑ 71. The-ocho, thexacha, in 6, is manifestly derived from the same
source as theachro, taxaca, in 7, 8, and theuca, texam (read
texacha) in 10. Theocb, theach, is properly an adjective derived
from theo, and consequently identical with A. S. peow, servilis
The latter follows the declension, both strong and weak, of the
adjectives; hence sreora and Jeowra (¹) in the genit. plur. (Caed-
mon’s GenesiS, 27 5 3), and also Ρεοτυηα in Ine’s LL. prooem. and § 1
as a variant of lieo-wa. That the A. 8. adjective has lost a Ιι (g) is
rendered probable by the Frankish word and the O. H. G. thiob-
muati= common thiomuati (s. Graff, Spr. ΙΙ, 696). If theocko in
6 and theuca (read theucka) in 10 be correct, the word must have
passed into the substantive declension. At any rate tlreoch properly
means “servilis ”; theat-hro and theochO, theucha, are genitives pl„
with the meaning of “servilium‚ hominum servilium, servitorum.”
It is difficult to decide whether chrochro in 6 is a second-hand
reading for theochro, or a real variant, charochro. Nor is it clear
what amba texaca in ιο representa. For thenca, in ὖ 8 of 10, we
have, of course, to read theucka ,· about the final a, as alternating
with 0, in the gen. plur„ cf. col. 456, note 1.

§ 72. Ismala in 6 and 10, also spelt chismala and exmala (Tit. XLI),
answers to M. D. smale, a maiden, a damsel. The spelling ex-
mala is so unequivocally and peculiarly French that Ι feel little
hesitation to ascribe the i in ismala to the influence os the idiom os
the scribes (²). Some Frank, or at least some person acquainted
with the Frank. language, knowing that i in Frankish was a dia-
lectic form of gi (chi), changed ismala into chismala, which has at
least a Frankish look about it. Smala will be a regular genit.
sing. of the fem„ provided the word, though originally an adjective,
followed the declension of the substantive& It is, however, just
possible that it is part of a compound, viz. smalatexaclza.

ᾇ 73. Decidedly a compound is teolasina, theolasz'na, theulasina,
which, in signification, scarcely differs from theoducco (cf. ξ 67). 1t
means “ seducing a servant.'' The Latin words “si quis homo in-
genuus (alienum servum) in texaca secum duxerit aut aliquid curn
eo negotiaverit ” have virtually the same purport as “ si servus cum
ipso ingenuo de rebus domini sui aliquid portaverit '’ in the and ἑ of
1, except that in the latter phrase it is left undecided whether the
servant or the freeborn man has taken the initiative. Theolasina,
seducing a servant, decidedly points to the servant having been a

(²) Ι am at a loss to understand why Grein changed the reading of the
MSS. into Peowna.
(²) So, too, we find in cod. B astralon instead of stratorem in ἱ 2 in the col.

of codd. 7, 8, 9.
