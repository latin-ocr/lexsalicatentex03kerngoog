NOTES. Trrr. XXXII. XXXIII.

·“ to defend, protect, secure against ”3 e. g. Andreas 1145: ‘¹ Hine
God forstod ha'ebenum folee ’⁹ ς Ine’s LL. 62: ‘⁸ Gif hine for& nelle
forstondan‚” in Latin: “ Si ei praeesse nolit ” (Schmid‚ Ges„ p. 5ο).
Where protection is given against the legal authorities, for-standan
implies unwillingness to deliver up a culprit3 thus we find it in
Aethelst. LL. 11, 1, 42 “ And gif hine hwa forstande, forgilde hine be
his were,” in Latin: ‘⁴ Et si quis obstabit, persolvat se were sua.”
This agrees exaetly with the Fris. LL. 116, 3 = “ Theresterhwbsane
(i. e. the eriminal pauper) hovi jeftha hssse jestha eniga monne
vrstonde, hundred mer-k thAIioden to fretha,” i. e. “ Thereafter who-
soever gives him shelter or lodging or is unwilling to deliver him up,
a hundred marks to the people for a satisfaction (frethus).'’ The
Ο. Ν. term stando ffn'r is, in point of fact, the same, e. g.
Grag. 11, 12 ε “ Of pat er maUr stendr fyrir weganda‚” i. e. ‘⁶ De eo
si quis homicidam protexerit ”3 see the whole chapter 1. c. and cf.
p. 1 153 the corresponding substantive is ffirstab'a, propugnatiO,
pp. 12 and 115 (misunderstood and with imperfect reference in
Oxf. Dict.). A third shade of meaning, viz. to resist, obstruet,
shows itself in the Fris. LL. 43, 5 : ‘⁶ Thet him sin fiand thene wie
vrstdde mith wige and mith wepne,” i. e. “That his enemy ob·
structs his way with fight and with weapons ”3 so too O.N. stando
fflrir, Grag. 11, 92. To it belongs A. S. foresteall, sorsmll, defined
as “coactio vel obsistentia in via regia ” (ef. Schmid, Gloss. i. v.
forstall). Forum! is either a 3rd pers. sing. pres. subj. of sora-
stdn = for-astundam or else an error for forestal. Forastadino is a
genit. or dat. c. of forastadin, formed like Ο. Η. G. irstandz‘n,
umbestandin, milarstandin, all os which have m' in the genit. sg.
(Graff, Spr. VI, 608). As to the absence of the nasal in the radical
syllable, cf. Ο. Ν. Ῑγήνείαῦα.

The crime stated in the § is the aet of a man who violently and
with force os arms saves another from the justice of the grafio,
Hence the heaviness of the penalty, which would be out of propor-
tion if the offenee consisted in bring-ing somebody fettered into the
presence of the grafio. It is only 6 which has the reading “ ad
graphione,” but this proves nothing except that the common pro-
nunciatiou of ad was a, as it has continued to be ever since in
F reneh; hence the confusion between a and ad.

XXXIII.

ἦ 176. A deer “signum habens” is termed θυμία-130 in 2, in 6
manilio, in 7 treuuz'ciio, etc. Cod. 10 has a variant throum'do with
an initial th ,· so too throm’dioso in 1. Both initials are equally ad-
missible as well here as in some other cases where they appear.
Whatever may be the true explanation of this phonetieal pecu-
liarity, it is impossible for us to keep the two forms separate;
cf. Notes on Tit. VI.

In a highly interesting passage of the Prefaee to Merkel’ s edition
(p. xxvi„ sq.) Grimm pointed out the radieal identity of the terms
in this Title aud the trium, treudis· in L. Rip. 4² and Alam. 101.
He also hinted at the connexion between the words mentioned and
Ο. Η. G. mela, al. thr-uh, druh, compes, pediea; fuosdrub, pedica ς
balsdruclt, baga, boia, to which we may add the Ο. S. Ιιαιςεῇηιυι)
in Gl. Prud. 190 and 4¹9·

A further analysis of the multifarious terms is difficolt, especially
owing to the gender and ease being unknown. mauide, maui-
dz'o, tmckuuido in 10 look like the dat. or instr- fem. of aeompound
consisting of tro(h), clamos), trech ει Ο. Η. G. truh, aruh, andrm'da,
wath = A. S. ωίδῠι, restis, loramentum Ο. Fris. wamba, mm,
wooden collar3 cf. O. Fris. mflubtn, viiie„ wedeben, A. S. ταίδο-

su

Ua

Mn (Aethelb. LL. 52), Ο. Ν. νίδόιὺια, m’iibex'n, the collar-bone.
Trochwido, Μίάὼ accordingly must mean as much as ⁴⁴ with a
truh bound at the eollar.” That such a dative case may be used to
express what otherwise a participle or adjective doeS, appears from
O. H. G. fuozdruhun, -thruhin, rendered by “ compeditus ” (see
Graff, Spr. V, 255).

Trouandio, i. e. trvwandio in 10, treuimdio, read treuwindzb, and
trioiubeo, read trioindeo, i. e. mowindzb in 9, are explieable on the
supposition that πσὶᾱία was replaced by a synonymous wandia and
tm‘ndia, derivatives from windan, torquere3 cs. O. H. G. fahswin-
da = fahs-witta, discriminalia (Graff, Spr. 1, 760 and 746), and
Ο. N. vinbeina = mbbeina. Tnbiobzb in 7 has gone oue step
further in the wrong direction than tnbiubeo, read trim'ndeo ,· the
final io, however, is right.

Tromlu'do in 2 shows the same trove), whereas πίε-ἰὼ is appa·
rently allied to D. wisse, vimen, restis (s. Kss. i. v.), Flemish
τοὶς-ειη, made os wicker-5 Goth. mss, a band, in gamlrs, ἃφή ,· date-
wirs, ἀνάλυσις. Wissida, in dative e. wissido, as an amplified form
of wis-si, ωιὶςεὶα, is perfeetly intelligible (¹). The exact counterpart
of Ο. H. G. urstendida in relation to Goth. usstass, resurrectio,
would, however, be τοίᾱὶιῖα (ωιᾈιῖὴα) a weh-s, not mirsida. It is
possible also that wzkst‘do represents a partic. pas& of a verb
wales-tim, to tie, attach. If so, the word cannot but be the weak
masc. nomin. of tmwitsid. Thmm'dtbso and thmueinso in 1,
neither of which can be right, seem a mixture of two various read-
ings: thr-omli& and thmmkso.

Uuasnouida in 6 is obviously wrong too, and the correction
uncertain. Wi5·trvm'dan would be the aecus. masc. of trowid =
0. H. G. gedruhot, gedruoht, compeditus3 zois-tm& like ξείνοι-
druhet (cf. Graff, Spr. V, a 55, sq.). By a slighter change we get
wimonidaw), trained, aecustomed to the τοὺς, the tie3 wom'an tobe
taken in the sense of O. S. veniat, wenna'tzn, assuefacere, Ο. N.
vensis, to train, tame, ete„ or Ο. Η. G. gravanea, adsuescere3 cf.
N. H. G. gewb‘hnt and Ο. S. giwono, D. gewoon, E. roone. The a
in the ending instead of an may be right, because in various
Frankish dialects, High, Middle, and Low, a final n is apt to
be dropped. A weak neuter nomin. or aecus. in a would be
entirely the Ο. S. form; nor would a weak masc. nomin. in a be
strange, consider-ing the relative frequency osa for o in the Heliand.

§ 177. “ Domestieum” is expressed by chamstala in 10, (mame-
stalla in 7, (mames-tella in 9, from cham, hamc, synonymous with
chem, and the adjective stalli, Ο. Fris. stalle, steady. The adjec-
tive is derived from stall with the suffix which has been gradually
superseded by ig. The form is apparently a weak neuter in the
nomin. or accus. case: the word sor a deer, stag, may have been a
neuter, say dior, A. S. deor, or even amc, lamet, for the latter,
though a maseul. in A. S., Ο. Ν., and Germ„ is neuter in M. D.
and N. D.

ξ 178. Amernonis the weak aecus. masc. ofan adjective arm,
radicallyagreeing with Ο. Ν. varim: and entirely= Ο. Η. G. ar·
somn, amman, confectus, decrepitus· whence ementi, senium
(seeGraff, Spr. Ι, 944). SineeA. 8. wem-niun, fomem'an, tabe-
scere, seuescere; weng, E. ωπον, mm'ed, ete„ belonging to the
same family, are related to amis-ruha, fomism'an, fomes-naim, are-
seere; Ο. Η. G. ame-raum, etwas-enon, it is not surprising to meet
with hamassina in 6. The Ιι is, of course, a eoekneyism and the
spelling differs, but otherwise the difference is small. Yet we

(¹) 1 cannot see any reason why Ο. H. G. wa‘tede (eontraeted ωέέὰι) aa the
MS. given it, should be changed into αἰπὰ,- aee (ἔπιθ’, Spr. 1, 760.
