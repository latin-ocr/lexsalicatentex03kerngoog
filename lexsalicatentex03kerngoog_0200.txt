humbertum, which is identical with chamestalia in 10, or am (by
assimilation for an) bsstalie, i. e. ‘⁶ in office.”

ᾇ 217. Mica· in 6, ‘nniciin 10 is a misread witi, uuiti, Ο. S. witi,
A. S. wite, Ο. N. viti, punishment, penalty, fine. Dructhe (i. e.
druchte), εἰναι-ἦε, read druthe (i. e. druhte), means a company, the
contubernium of the Latin text; Goth. drauhts (stem drauhti),
A. S. ‹ir-stat, 0. N. drdtt, O. H. G. trultt, etc. Druchte·witi, i. e.
“contubernii poena,” means what in A. S. is called 11th in
Alfr. LL. 29- 31, the contents of which may serve to illustrate the
jargon of the Lex Salica ε “ Gis mon twyhyndne mon unsynnigne
mid hlese ofslea, gielde se pm sleges andetta sie wer and wite,
and aeghwelc mon pe on paem sisse waere geselle 30 scill. t6 Ιιὶδδ-
ὀόίε. Gis hit sie syxhynde mon, aelc mon te ῘιΙὸδ-ὸὸἰε 60 scin. and
se slaga wer and ful wite.”

The aim of the quasi-correction consisting in the insertion of li, le

is beyond my comprehension. Did the corrector think of druct- ·

heliwtta', penalty of the company's fellows Ρ for heli may be A. S.
hale, Ο. N. Italr, a man. Or did he add heli, hele, half, Ο. Fris·
hal, M. D. 1ιεὶ in helt, the half, in order to intimate that not the
fulwiti, fulwite was to be imposed on the ‘⁶ alii tres ” ? However
this may be, the original term is dmchte-wtti, because this alone

agrees with albebat and with the other Malberg, scolastrafia (thus .

to read instead of the corrupted forms in 6 and ιο). Scola, A. S.
scolu, Ο. S. scola, M. D. schole, E. shoal is a band, a contubernium,
and in so far synonymous with drucht, though it may have
denoted more particularly a band of three persons3 cf. the conjec-
ture on the Malb. scltodo in Tit. X111 (q. v.). Stra fia, D. stmffe,
Germ. strase, penalty, belongs to the verb D. straffm, O. Fris.
,τίνα-ἤϊα, Icel. straffa(1), N. H. G. strafen.

Both dmchtewtti and scolastrafia may be rendered by ‘⁴ penalty
for the whole band,” and 1 think both must have been used pro·
miscuously in the sense of A. S. Ιιὶδδ-ὀὸτ. If there was a conven-
tional differ-enee between the two terms, it cannot lie in the
restrictiori of scola to a gang of three men, for the same number is
mentioned in the passage where the Malb. has druchtewfti.

§218. For alatfaltkeo in 6 and 10 read alachfartheo; in 3
alachfarthaeb. 1t is difficult to see what the m before alach in 3

meanS. Could the original have had ‘⁴111 (pron. thr-iore, trium ·

hominum) alachsarthtb, villae invasioni '' Ρ This much is certain
thatin the J’argon of 6 we find some support for our conjecture3 “ tres
villas euaserit ” is nonsense, of course, but “tres villam invaserint '’
would suit. Cod. 10, not inaptly, puts it in this way: “ villas alienas
(read villam alienam) cum tribus.” The wording of 1 and 3 is
wrong-3 there can be no question of an alachfarthi by one person,
because this case is provided for elsewhere. The compilet of 1
probably found in his source “ si quis et tres alii,’' or something like
it ; et tres has become with him et res.

ξ 219. Scolandi stadtb, etc.. is paraphrased: “ illi qui remanent
unum convictum de se dare debent.” This affords us the clue to
restoring the original reading, which should be in 2 scolandis sta·
dio ; in 6 scolandes stadio ; in 7-9 scolanthis sthddio ,· in 10 scolan-
des stlzadz'o. Scolandzlc, -aes, -nthir, is the genit. c. of the pres.
part. scoland, scolanth, Ο. Η. G. scolant(er), etc„ from scolan, Goth.

(²) It is very likely that the Icelanden borrowed their εἰη] and stmffa,
but certainly not from the German as the Oxf. Dict. state· it. Tire double f
suffice· to show that the origin of straffis not to be looked for in German.

skulan, to be guilty. Stadia, cumbrously spelt seburim, is the
nom. act. of stadian or stadonhn, Ο. H. G. steten, statem, scalon,
statuere, Ο. N. stessja, to fix, appoint, permit ς cf. N. H. G. gestat-
ten, to permit, allow. We may render scolandis stadia by “ putting
the culprit at one's disposal.” Ι feel uncertain as to the case of
stadio ,· it is apparently a dative, which may have been governed
by some phrase like “ condemned to.’'

Seolan doueua of 3 (for which see ᾗῇ 97, 99, 101) is wholly ont of
the question; it is an unfortunate conjecture for scolandes stadio,
stadina, or something approaching to it.

ᾗ 220. Druchte lidio in 10, along with its variations in the other
texts, is, Ι think, the genit. plur. of -lidi, -chlidi, i. e. a mascul.
stem in ia derived from a word agreeing with Ο. N. blau, side,
latus. From the same word seems to have been formed the
obscure 0. H. G. tideo, adlator (Ρ), adulator, though with another
suffix (s. Graff, Spr. H, 192). Analogous to it is Skr. sapakska‚
belonging to the same side, party, from pakslta, side, party.

If the explanation here attempted is right, drucktehlidio must
have been governed by the word indicating “ three ''; the corre-
sponding phrase in the Latin text will be “ tres de eo contubernio-'²
though the literal rendering would be “ three of the associatoe in
the band.” The corrected readings will be: dructiltlido in 2:
drocthledio in 33 dructeclalidio in 6; dmctchlidio, droctlriiio in 7-9;
dructelidz’o in 10. The initial h occasionally disappears, e. g. in leo
for Iuleo (Tit. XVI).

It is not unlikely that there was some confusion between hlidi
and lida, i. e. O. N. livi, a follower, mang O. H. G. lito in ki·
tn'uwa liton, fideiussores (s. Gra-ff, H, 192). 1 do not intend to
inquire how far hlidi may be connected with A. S. gehma, which
in Elene 1 13 means “ an inmate, denizen ’⁹ ; in the compound wil-
gemo (Riddle 15, 5) the same as wilgesw, a boon companion. I
only wish to remark that the a· in the Malb. might be the Umlaut of

δ, though it is not necessarily so, hence the uncertainty.

1 am, moreover, bound to state that 1 would prefer to explain
dmchtehlidio, etc„ as signifying ‘⁴ solidarity of the band,” if 1 saw
any means of supporting such a suggestion by instances of a similar
use of a feminine hlidia or gehlidia (or hlddia, hloedt‘a, Media).
That from druchtehlidi, associate, an abstract noun, femin. or
neuter, may be formed in the sense of “saltuarityss’ is scarcely
doubtful ς cf. the obscure Ο. N. hleyti, Meti, letati, Ieyti, leiti, con-
sanguinity, a share.

ᾗ 221. Κίρ, rap, Goth. ναι-Ὧς, A. S. θήρ, Germ. reis, etc., ‘⁸ a rope,
hoop,” is a well-known Teutonic word. What it means in the
Frank. law is fully illustrated by its Ο. N. synonym, viz. baugr.
Baugr, in the first place, means a ring, armlet; secondly, to use
the phrase of the Oxf. Dict„ “in old times baugr simply means
money. In the law the payment os weregild is particularly
called baugr” ς in the third place it is a round shield. From such
compounds as bauga-tal, bauga-maor, bauga-brot it appears that
in Ο. N. the word was used in the singular and the plural without
any marked distinction, in the same manner as our money and Lat.
nummi amount to the same thing. To complete the perfect
parallelism between rep and baugr only one thing is wanting:
namely, the proof that baugr was occasionally also applied in case
of matrimonial coemption. · This proof is supplied by the following
passages in the A. S. poem Guomica (Greia, 2, 342): “Cyning
sceal mid ceape ewene gebicgan‚ bunum and befigum ”z and in
