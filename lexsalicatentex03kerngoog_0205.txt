and chanthrgiu, contagio, cantab, ganah, identified with A. S.
kente, Ο. N. hendi, prehendo, apprehendo, capi03 and he renders
the two words combined by “ fibula, torque stringo.” This expla-
nation is plausible enough, yet 1 doubt its correctness, not so much
because next, nexti does not occur (for there is reason to believe
that Ο. N. ntis-t, a brooch, pin, and kindred words really stand sor
nz'lzst), as because, so far as 1 know, no symbol or symbolical
phrase of the kind survives in any of the other Teutonic laws. 1
would rather think that there is some connexion, either real or in
theory, between thuregin and thzgio, the last word of the formula,
and likewise between tungin and tuffo. Now thigr‘an is, apparently,
0. S. thiggi'an, petere; Ο. H. G. digjan, petere, expetere, inter-
cedere, impreeari3 aigi, petitiO, imprecatio, intercessio. From the
rendering ‘⁶ intercedere ” it follows that tlnggian, digy‘an is a varia-
tion of tkingon, A. S. pingian, intercedere, veniam petere. As for
agian, tian (tibrim, ἄεΙιίαη), this is the counterpart of A.' S. teok-
kian‚ tihkz'ezn, to appoint, judge, pass judgmeut (cf. Bosw. Dict. and
Grein, GlosS. i. v.). To it belongs intinget, which Grein rightly
compares with Ο. H. G. insilit, crimen, but which in most cases
means causa. Now, causa, mench chose, is in its development
wholly analogous to Teutonic Jn‘ng, so that intinga and ping are
synonymous. If we take antigio instead of the simplex ἅμα, the
word may be regarded as the verbal form coordinate with the
subst. intinget. This agrees very well with ‘⁴ mallare,” by which
the Lex Emend. has replaced the Salic term: the codices 6-10
also see ‘⁴ mallo '' in it. At the same time the Lex Emend. render-s

tlu‘gr'us or ligius—it is doubtful which—by ‘⁸ adstringas ”3 cod. 3 ·

has “ teneo.’' It is uncertain whether A. S. ontyhtan, incitare,
impellere, belongs to tedlum or to ethan ,· but why should not the
interpreters have seen in the ι’ of tigian the Umlaut of u f In this
case tr‘giezn would in the main answer to A. S. getlgean, geffgan,
constringere, E. to tie ; ‘⁴ adstringens-’² of the Lex Emend. points to
antr‘gr‘o=antygi0. Cf. Grimm, R. A. 855: ‘⁸ Der gegner oder gusa-
chio heisst, passiv genommen, der beklagte, gesorderte, belongtffi
puls-atus, der x'nzassztigo N. Bth. 57, der bemalb‘tdss’

Nextich, nestig 1 take to be an adverbial form like O. H. G.
mats-tig, meisdc, potissimum, of the superlative ntxt, nest, M. D.
naest, dial. neest, N. D. naast and nauwst, next, most closely, A.S.
neahst, ullast, m‘hst, for the last time, O. N. naest, next, nearest, last,
elosest. Nextrjg is here to be taken in the sense of ‘⁶ most closely”;
O. N. nesta, very; noer, near, close, sharp. Consequently the
formula might be rendered: “I most urgently compel'’ or. “ 1
enjoin.” Hic-hio, tngio, tio is the 1 pers. sing. preS. ind., whereas
thichim, tz'gius, tiliis· is the 2 pers. sing. in the subj. mood. The
ending ius answers to Ο. S. ies, eas, analogously to the ending of
the genitive us, where Ο. S. has as, es. Cf. ἑ 271.

§ 239. Gasaciois the A. S. gesaca, adversariuS, aemulus.

ᾗ 240. Κασήὐε·, ναὲἰηόηνέϊ, etc. (ὁ 3) is cithera stem in i or in ia.
The Latinized forms decide nothing, nor the apparently Frankish
plurals burg-ies, burgioe in 9. 1f the stem ended in ia, the plural
burg-ie, i. e. burgis would be the counterpart of einde, fines, in the
Frankish of a later period, viz. Ps. 66, 8; ercetere Gl. L. 259. Cf.
the formation of Goth. hairdetk, Ο. N. Ιιίνδίν, Ο. Η. G. lu‘rti,'etc. ;
Ο. N. ha‘lmir, hersin

The etymology of rachine, ragr‘ne, melain, ragin, rechine, regen
is not quite clear; both Goth. ragin, δόγμα, γνόμη, οἰκονομία,
and the verb rahnjan, ψηφίζειν, ἂειοΰν; gar-ahman, τιμᾶν, may
claim to be related. The Raginburgi is (as appears ex. gr. from Tit.
LVII) what in Goth. is called rogim, σύμβουλος. 011 the other
hand he is a taxator: “ pretium appretiare debet,'' and in so far he

⁵³9

may be identified with the Ο. Fris. werdmon, wmhmon, which
apparently means ‘⁸ worth-man, esteemer,” as well as ‘⁴ in esteem,
worthy,·’ especially a churchwarden. The Skr. word nearest re-
lated to rugiae is arbam, arhagtd, esteem, worship, from arban}
to be worth, valuable, grave, powerful, etc., whence arkant ‘⁸ a
worthy, a master, upper teacher,” but Gr. ἅρχων.

Rathim (the m in rachimb. is due to assimilation) in 10, here and
in Tit. LVI (LIX), as well as ratioru in 4„ seem to be more the
results of adaptation than clerical errors3 cf. Goth. rapr, account,
reckoning3 O. H. G. redimi, ratio; narratio; N. D. reden, reason,
account3 M. D. redenc, ratiO, causa; sermo, oratio, etc.

Burgi is both he who takes up, upholds, and he who begins or is
the first, ἅρχων, ἀρχόμενοι-ς cf. D. beuren, to heave, take up,
receive what is due; Ο. Ν. byry'a, to support, begin, be due,
beseem, get. A vicarious form of burgi (like Ο. Η. G. burjo of
burgio) is buri in Ο. S. and O. H. G. hardbun‘, magistratus (¹).
That the Franks attributed to their mgi'nburgii the function os
persons who take what is due, i. e. of D. hearers, seems evident
from the phrase: ‘⁶ pretium quantum valuerit debimm de fortuna

illius tollant.”
LI.

ξ 241. Andometo, antkomito in the rubric of 2 is a semi-Latin
alteration of anetomitho, by assimilation antom'tho. In 10 we
must read andtomitlw. In 5 and 6 two readings have been
blended: anttometlw (anatomiam) and anstimetlw (andtemitlw).
Andtbmitha, in dative case -tho, is derived with the suffix itha from
an adjective andwm'i, like Goth. diupipez, depth, from diups ; A. S.
ymsso from earm, and the like. And, usually meaning ‘⁴ against,”
“adversely,” is here taken in the sense os ‘⁸ contrary ”3 cf. the
remark on and in Tit. XLV. Synonymous with this and is widri,
and consequently andtdmi is essentially the same as O. H. G.
m‘derzdmi, being against the law, in ‘⁴ Want is widerzame duhte,
azzen Juden mit heidiniskme liute ’⁹ (s. Graff, Spr. V, 666). The
e in andtemi may be the Umlaut οἷά, and in that case the formation
would coincide, with that of widmami ,· it may, however, be just as
well the Umlaut os δ. The latter alternative is the more probable
os the two. It is not impossible that the corruptions in 5 and 6 are

caused by a reading ποιέω-ιω, anatomitho. The o. Fris. term
untame, ventanae, i. e. insormality in law, is nearly allied to andtomt'-
tha ,· the adjectiveis antemelik, explained as being ‘⁶ exceptio dilato-
ria,'' but from a passage in the Fris. Laws (251) it is quite clear that
antemelik means, in general, “ informal in 1aw.’' The passage runs
thus :—“ Diu onscheldingha is twyra honda wijs, deer thi sitter hyn
myde unscheldigia mei. Diu erste diu hat dilatoria, dat is unteme-
lick, hwent aldeerby werth dyu seke unteyn. Det is untemelick als
di sitter sprect tojenes den riuchter, under tidum tqjenes det riucht,
under tidum tojenes den onspreker jes syn foerspreka‚ jesta tojenist
da tyd der hi uppa ladit is.”

In O. Fris., just as in A. S., the prefixes and and un interchange
so very osten—the above quotation gives an instance in anscheldi·
gia, onscheldiffia, and unteyn (²)—that we may safely consider
untame (FriS. LL. 254) to have arisen from unttame n anetam ,-
oentame (252, 21, and 254, 14> still more decidedly points to an
older antam, anttame. The prefix ant (ent) can all the more easily

(²) Hand is of uncertain origin ς 1 identify it with Skr. kraha, both “ coun-
sel ” and ‘¹ power,” Gr. κράτος.
