NOTES. TIT. LV.

D. wortel, a root. After premising thus much, we may identisy
mandwale with Skr. magrado, a disc, circle, circuit, anything
round, especially as it is used in ειύῥαηιαῃᾷαὶα, properly “ a
mound-circle‚ a tope-round,” but commonly not differing from
stupa, a tope. A synonymous word, viz. himba, is equally used in
the more or less pleonastic compound sitiphim, which denotes
the same as the single stupa, in its sense οῖ an artificial grave-
mound, a tope. The precise Aryan form of Skr. magedda has not
yet been ascertained, but this much is pretty certain that the word
is alrin to Ο. Ν. mondull “the handle of a hand mill”; to Skr.
mancha, the eburning3 manthana, chumstick 3 manthant, a churn,
etc. Mandwale may be rendered by ‘⁸ the fenced mound, mound-
fence, framework of the mound,” in short stupa-maqdala.

ἦ 249. Silone, whatever may be its correct form, bears some
resemblance to A. S. sylle, syl, basis, fulcimentum, postis; cf.
Ο. Η. G. suli “lignum quod sustinet ostium domna, quod nos
salium vocamus ” (cf. Graff, Spr. VI, 190). It alternates with
O. H. G. suelli ,· cs. Goth. gas-aljan, θεμελιοῦν. In M. D. sulle,
st'lleis “limem” but at the same time “canalis,” just like sijlc, which
is apparently another form os Ο. Fris. sil, a sluice, a little bridge,
N. D. ²²le a sewer, and dialect. a sluice (cf. Tit. XXH). 1f these
or similar words existed in the Salic tongue—-and it would be
strange is it were otherwise—then we can understand how the
arrangers os our texts have adopted the readings ‘⁶ ponticulus ” and
“porticulus’' Still 1 confidently assert that the older Latin text
had something different, sor “ponticulus (or porticulus) sequens
mortuum'' is nonsense. Both the Latin text and the Malb. have
been ill treated. The Malb. must have had uhawale (in 5 sila-
ωηο), etymologically almost Ο. H. G. sinamus, globus (Graff, Spr.
1, 840), and differing little from mandwale, save in so far as it is
more distinctly expressive of the vault-like, the globular shape of the
mound, the Ο. N. haugr. Such a sinamle is not unaptly rendered

- by ‘⁴ monticulus.” The revisers, not understanding the Malb„

which perhaps was already somewhat corrupted, obtained, by dint
of etymology, from siluae, as they read or conjectured, a little
bridge, and therefore changed monet-:dus into ponticulus.

Sequentem (dis) mortuum, which we find in 5 and 6, is a most
interesting phrase, to understand which we ought to re-translate it
into Salic. Τὴο original word probably was aster, astar, after,
the very same expression which in the sense os ‘⁶ in memory of ”
(the dead) is constantly used in the Runic tombstones; verpa hang
ast-ir, ast, aster, etc. (cs. Jonsson, Oldn. Dict. i. v. φῆν). It is clear
that a ‘⁶ monticulus,” a haugr, a cairn in memory of the dead, is a
suitable phrase, but not ‘⁶ ponticulus.’'

θ 250. For chlebarbio in 8, cheolbarbio in 7, cheobarbio in 9 (Tit.
xlv), we must read chuobardio. cmo is A. S. hldw, hloew,
Goth. alaim, etc., tumulus. Bar-dio, also in 10 (Tit. LV), recalls
O. N. barli, brim, edge, e. g. os a hill; the stem differi-‚3 neither the
gender nor the mse can be determined. The compound chleobardi,
is appearances do not deceive us, is “tumuli margo.’' The question
arises whether the Malb. in 7-9 is a conjecture or a genuine variant,
a term handed down from ancient times. This is a point which 1
sear has little chance os ever being settled. We can only say that
chnobardio is wrong, while cinnabar-gub is right. The most natural
interpretation of this term, so far as Ι can see, would be ‘⁴ the
hutini-place of a dead man ;‘’ cs. Frankish burgis-li, sepulcrum, Gl.
L. 171 ; A. S. byrgen‚ burgen, sepulcrum, etc. It denota, how-
ever, at the same time an enclosure, a fence, like Ο. N. hyr-gi.
From ‘⁸ ponticulus ’² or “ porticulus ” may be gathered that the
originators os this secoudary reading interpreted bur-gia as a vicarious

⁵47

form os brug-ia, Ο. Ν. brygg-ta, ponticulus: A. S. hrycg, Ο. Η. G.
brucca, N. H. G. bracke, D. brugge, brug, etc. They were, to a

certain extent, justified in doing so, sor along with brug-ia the pro·
nunciation burg-ia was not alien to the idiom, as we are able to test
by a charter (already quoted more than once) os Ebroin, A. n. 720,
where the name of the village at present called Donsbruggen, not
far from CleveS, is first written Dangaesbrvcla, and a few lines
further down Da(n)gaaeburge. In this way it may be explained
how the revisers arrived at their interpretation, which, however,
cannot be the right oue. Chnoburgia is clearly the tumulus over
the bones of a dead man, the burial-place. Bur-gab is very likely
the accus. of a seminine3 occasionally in the Heliand o occurs for a
in the same caseg rorgo, 24, 24 ; sundeo, 56, 8, etc. (cf. Sehmeller
in his ed. 2, 183).

ᾖ 251. Chaminis is the gen. of chamini, mutilation, hurting, and
here to be taken in the same sense as the corresponding Skr. verb
parnndti “ to hurt, violate ’⁹ shows as well as the substantive
famula, a pollution, unhallowing, violatiug. We may render cka-
mt'm' by ‘⁴ profanation.” We have no means to decide whether the
profanation os a dead body was really restricted to the peculiar case
stated in the text. Codd. 6- 10 have a different term: edulcus,
dulgas, hidulgus. It would seem that the interpreters saw in it
id, ed, rursus, A. S. ed, D. ed (et) (in ederikken, Ο. H. G. aemon,
ruminare; A. S. edoman); in agmen, astermath, etc. This suppo-
sition would explain the wording os the paragraph. N evertheless it
is evident that chamini* contains nothing akin to the notion of
‘⁴ again, repeatedly.” If possible, we must try to reconcile cha-
nu'm's and idulgus. The problem is, up to a certain extent, easily
solved, for A. S. aideh‘an is (Beda 2, 13) exactly· “profanare ”3
idaim, exinanire, initare3 O. H. Garftaljan, exinanire, evacuare,

vastare ς· admissa, desolatio. Therefore‚ we may conclude that '

{dulgas means “ profanation,” leaving it undecided whether the
deed consists in spoiling, wasting, or emptying the receptacle of its
contents; cf. M. D. den pot zj‘delen, to empty the pot or box. On
account of chamini: we must understand &ulgus in the wider
sense os profanation, iu accordance with the notiou os ‘⁴ insolent,
wanton‚” which the adjective idel shows. The grammatical form
of idulgus is not clear, though it may be asserted that the corre-
sponding verb must have been idulgian, &alig-iam the amplified
adjective idulig, idulg (cf. E. soolr'sh andsool); which, used in the
neuter, would yield a genitive {dulgas ; cf. the analogous A. S.
words (related in signification also) dysegr'an, ineptare; dysig‚
stultus, insanus3 ‹lys-ig, stultitia, insania.

ξ 252. ΝοεΙιο, noff-, of which nauch, naus foundin some MSS.
seems to be either a more ancient or a semi-French spelling, is
allied not only to Icel. ndr, a smith's trough, and to Ο. Η. G. noch,
foramen, cuniculus, but also to Ο. Fris. nost, a pit, ditch. In
modern North-Frisian nost means a trough, which is remarkable,
because in Ο. Η. G. we find drab as a synonym of noch .· “in nohin
vel in drohin, in canalibus'' (Graff, Spr. 11, 1015). Now, Ο. H. G.
droh is A. S. ymb, loculus, sarcophagus3 Ο. N. pref, both “a
trough ’⁹ and ‘⁸ a stone coffin ’⁹ (steinprd). This again is identified
—not to say identical—with A. S. trah, trag, alveus, alveolus-»5
pelvis; navigium3 O. N. trog, D. trag, E. mugla, etc. F or all
practical purposes we may safely consider that prola -- trah, and
this as synonymous with noch, noh, and nost. In Tit. XIV the
paraphrase not unaptly has: “quae (scil. noff and petra) vasa ex
usu sarcophagi dicuntur.”

An older form of noch, noff, etc„ may be nochw, natm, or the
former is a bad pronunciation for nocht, nost, like machig for
