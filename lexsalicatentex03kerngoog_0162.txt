is easily explained why in 6 and 10 the stealing os a “taurus
ἄνωθ’ is fined with 35 sol. and that of the “ taurus qui gregem
10311 ” in other codd. with 45. 11 further the fine for a “ taurus
qui gregem regit'’ differs from that sor a “ taurus rex,'’ we may be
satisfied that there is something wrong in the codification, for the
two Latin expressions are virtually the same, and the Malberg
terms likewise. Ι 2111 1110 111010 inclined to reject the etymological
knowledge os the Frank. lawyers because in Skr. the trz’watm
(satida), the ‘⁸ three years old bull,” is a solemn term and, as the
use of watra in an obsolete sense shows, one of the highest anti-
tiquity. By rejecting the etymology given in the Lex 1 do not
mean to say that it was wholly groundless. On the contrary, there
must have been a word spel, spil, in the sense of “distr-iet,
division”; it occurs in Ο. Fris, szerekspel, Ο. H. G. kirspil,
N. H. G. kt'rchspzkl, D. kerspel, a parish ; Ο. Fris. eedspel, N. Fris.
espel, a district; Drentian dirigi-pil, dz'ngspal, jurisdiction. That
threspelli also 31311111οἀ “ 11110οῙ0111 ” will be seen below under Tit.
LXII. Hence probably the interpretation of chres-pilli as “ a

bull for three villages.’'

defined as comprising “ 12 vaccas cum tauro ”3 in the Salica it com-
prises a herd srom 12 up to 25 11021, according to circumstances.
The Latin words ‘¹ 12 animalia ut nec unus exinde remaneat '' seem
a clumsy way ofexpressing ‘⁸ a complete herd,” i. 0. 12 cows includ-
ing one bun. In the case of a complete herd number-ing more than
12 2111111213, the term sune-tta is rejected by 6, which uses ingymis
επακ-[ηπ 1110 purport of which would be that the stealing of 12 year-
lings is punishable by meod. The Latin words “ si qui super ipsis
duodecim remanserunt aliqui ” cannot have expressed the intention
os the law, and are contradicted by the Malberg. The isolated mal.
in 10 must be either 2 mistake or indicative of an omission of the

gloss.

ἕ 42. Α 3110111113 1211111 is ter-med lammi in 1, lap, read lamp, in 2,
lem in 10, leui in 6, leue in 7, 8, 9. Lammi has the appearance of
a diminutive, the original form of which would be lammih = lam·
ming ; cf. Frank. Psalm 67, 28 junge-lig, and, sor the dropping of
final h, the Malb. twalefti and the name Chlowi-s. The mm, for
which we should expect mh, is a surprisingly old example of the
assimilation of mh to mm, a process which afterwards has been
going 011 111 211 Το11101110 12113112303, Icelandic excepted (¹). In
M. D. we find an original mb treated in two wayS. Is 111121, 11
becomes either m (mm) or it passes into mp ‚· the latter according
to the D. rule that a media, at the 01111 of words and the first parts of
compounds, is replaced by the tenuis. The latter rule is very old in
Frank. 3 we see an instance of it in lamp in 2 for lamb, Goth. lamb,
etc. ; a somewhat later example is ‹lump-eide (for dump-lzez'de), in.
sipientiae, in Gl. L. 216. 111 a charter of A. D. 720 (²) by Ebroin
we meet with examples as Walamunt for -mund, and similarly
Gunt-brectus for granth. The Saxon Gl. Pr. 256 shows dump-
hedi, but dumb 132. The Frank Gl. L. 217, has dumben, insipienti.
M. D. has both domp-heit and dom-heia

It is not easy to account for the form lem. The e may be a
dialectic pronunciation of a, such as occasionally occurs in the
Ο. S. Gl. Mers.; s. Heyne, Kl. D. XIV. Considering the variant
leui in the more ancient cod. 6, and leue in 7, 8, 9, one feels rather

inclined to think that the original reading has been tampered with,
as leui strikingly reminds us of euui (ewa), agna, Gl. Pr. 740. The
l may be due to confusion between two 1021111133, [ammi and euni,
ewa.

ξ 43. A sheep osone or two years old is called lampsein 2. Τ111313 2
regular diminutive os lamb, by aid of the suffix se, which is identical
with O. N. si in hmssi (genit. Iar-usses), unghrussi, a young colt. A
cognate suffix is si, genit. sa in Ο. N. hru‘zi (hru'm), a young ram,
kussi, bas-si, and the like ; essentially the same is D. sin such words
as dreumzk, a dapperling, 010. It is difficult to understand how
Zampse, i. 0. 2 lambkin, 0211 110 2 101111 for sheep of one year and
upwardS. The proper word sor a yearling is ingymis, ingimus, as
is actually found in codd. 6-10, the affinity os which with Icel.
gemsi and gemlingr, a year old sheep (s, oxs. Dict. i. ι), 13 21 this
place particularly striking. We may be satisfied that lempse was a
term alternating with lamp, 21111 11 13 probably owing to some error
that it is put twice in the wrong place. The same applies to Iami-
lam in 1, which is moreover a corrupted reading, apparently con-
sisting os two wordS, lam(m)i and lam ,· 1110 former may more
particularly be 2 “ lambkin‚” the latter ‘¹ a lamb ” 111 general.

ᾗ 44. Aflock of 40 (5ο) sheep and upwards is called sunnis-ta, sonz’sta
in 1, 5, 6, somitchalt, read sonirthalt, in 10. Quite different is feto
in 2, 9, ,ἵζευ 111 7, freto in 8. The same word is found also in the
compoundfetusclaeeto in 7, fretu sckaeto in 8, νείκει-01110 111 9. It is
not easy to understand how the same word can denote at one time
2 12130 110011 os 40 01 50 sheep, and at another time a small one os
only three animals. The difficulty will be removed by assuming
that setuscheto, etc., ought to follow after the words “ qui numerus
usque ad 40 berbices ’³ and not after “si tres furaverit.’' It may
further be supposed that the original reading was ferta, fem (for
fmuh, fertoh), O. Η. G. florsug, Ο. S. fienich, vict-tib, vn'arteg,
etc., D. veertzgg forty. Scheto, schaeto, reminds us of Ο. Fris.
sket, genit. skettir, cattle, but the single t, and to a certain extent
the vowel e, makes the identification of the two words rather doubt-
ful. On the other hand we find in 10 fetzlrchqfo along with feisse·
cho. With a slight change, fretuscetho resolves itsels into fertm:
(i. e. fertug) fec-ho or faech, which 1 take to have been the original
reading. Feclzo is apparently the Goth. faihu, etc. ; it may be
a sing. or a pl., like fio and fe, pecus, pecora, in the Frank. Psalms;
s. Heyne, Kl. D. p. 119. In fazkseth os 6 1110 30001111 syllable is
probably a 01011021 error forfecb = fe of Psalm 67, 1 1. If in 10 we
transpose the letters of ckeso thus, fecho, we get fetzlrfecho, which
must have originated from the same source as the supposed -feclae in 6.
Fetis may be an error forfertih= O. S. fiem’clz ,· thus the form fer-
tuc, serta, seno, supposed sor 2, 7, 8, 9, would be a variety os
fenile. Fais in 6 looks very strange. Is it showed no connexion
with seis and fetis in 10, one might think of identifying it with
Ο. N. saer, Swed. far, Dan. saar ,· in which case fais-sech, sets-
fecho would literally be ‘⁶ sheep cattle” (cf. the Icel. expression
geiffl). Unfortunately the other codd. are not favourable to such
2 supposition. I dare not propose the change offois-seth into fian
ιιι-11, which, stom a grammatical point of view, would be unobjec-
tionable, but can hardly be made to harmonise with the forms in 10.
11 we wish to reconcile the readings os 6 and 10, two codices which
are undoubtedly near relatives, we must change the reading os 6
into fiartech sech.
