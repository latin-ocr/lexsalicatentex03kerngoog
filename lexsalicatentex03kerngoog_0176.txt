NOTES. TIT. XVII.

deffen, stupefacere. Dosa, if it has a long vowel, would be D.
dooven, to quench, Ο. Ν. deyfa, to stupefy.1s the short vowel is
intended, it would agree m. m. with D. dos, dull, hollow, dead;
deff-en, to knock, thrust. The secondary nature of cffisa, al. desa, 01
10111 110 doesa (¹), at least in 2, is rendered highly probable by the
fact that this codex consistently shows de, with two exceptions, viz.
in ᾗ 3 where it has docfa, and in the next Tit. where we find ‘⁴ se-
lando sunt effa.’' This looks uncommonly like an indirect proof
of what has just been asserted. The writer seeing qffa added above
the line or in the margin, and not knowing where to place it, put it
behind sunt, instead of before it. In short, desa, dosa, deffa were
indiscriminately used in the sense which these words themselves or
their cognate forms have preserved up to this day, but do was vanish·
ing from the memory of the rising generations in its meaning os
‘⁸ hurting by blows,’' though otherwise it remained 10 1130 for some
time longer (²). Therefore it was replaced by a clearer, living word,
first in the old cod. 1 and partly 10 2; afterwards it was wholly
ousted in the later codices (⁸).

The conclusion we have arrived at agrees with what we find in
6- 10. Scolon doefa' 10 ᾗ 1 os 6 13 surely the same as seolan defa‘ m
ξ 2 ; 10 011101 words it is somehow a vicarious form ; dosa or docfa =
dbfa or doesa is a variant of desa. The terms in 7-10 have to be
corrected in the way explained in the preceding chapter. So, too,
we have to read seulan 110υοηο 01 douena in 4.

§ 108. Wounding of the 1113111 13 called σῶζε-ὠὴ chii-io frit in 2,
uiuis-227 seth in 1. Fn'th (sor frid) is a perfectly intelligible vicarious
form offirth ;feth is obviously the same word, whether it be a clerical
error sor serth or, what 1 think more probab1e‚ a corrupted form
of it, like Ο. Fris. bem-wedene for ·-werdene‚ etc. Nothing is more
common in F risian and later Saxon than the almost or wholly
imperceptible sound of r before d, t or th (⁴). We have as cognate
words Ο. Fris. fer-eth, ferth, offence, injury; benfrotha, bonewound
(cs. Richth. GL, i. vv.) 3 A. S. sorad, sorod, sored, fractus, con·
tritus; e. g. LL. Aelfr. 62, 5ος O. H. G. fleti, livor vulneris;

fratbt, sauciat3 Langob. vradeht (walapaus) in Graff, Spr. ΙΙΙ, 819.

Chicszb, chais-io is the genit. pl. of a word denoting ‘⁸ cerebrum ’⁹ ;
the plural is used just like 10 Engl. hrains, D. her-senen. This much
is clear3 nor is it doubtful that chicsio, chrisio and uiuis-h point to one
30111110 same word, which, though Ι feel some hesitation in saying it,
must be chirsi, in the main Ο. Ν. hjarsi, Swed. lajesse, and D. her-
sen (⁸). It 13 by no means unlikely that chirsi was now and then less
nicely pronounced, just like hjarsiwhich becomes hjesse. In so far
cheffrido in ᾗ 3 of 6 may be due rather to a fault in pronunciation
than in copying. Frido exactly agreeS, as to the ending, with
O. Fris. ben-frothe. Sc, too, does fredo.

plur. genit. os ben, bone ς for the ending a instead oso in Saxon, cs.
Schmeller in his edition of the Heliand ΙΙ, 183. Anbilicoe is a
substantive belonging to a verb an-bilt‘can = anbltcan, to lie open,
patere. Save its having the prefix an, anbilice exactly answers to
A. S. blice in Aethelb. LL. ᾗ 34: ‘⁸ Gif bdnes blzice 11001δο8, 111
scillingum gebete.'’ The verb is A. S. blican, Ο. Fris. bltka, Ο. Ν.
blika, D. blzjken. cf. Fris. LL. p. 83, blicande blddresne, patens
(sanguinis) effusi0. It is not a little curious that the expression ‘⁸ si
exinde tria ossa exierint,’' which sounds rather strange in Latin,
agrees with the Frisian thria bena uutgong (1. 0.), rendered by
“pro trium ossium (scil. capitis) exitu.” It is by no means impro-
bable that the Salic original of the text, represented in 1 and 2, had
something like it, and that inan bena anblice was a variation found
in other 30111003, just as in the Fris. LL. (1. 0.) thn‘ra bena brebe is
to thria bena uutgong.

ὖ 1 10. A wound in the short ribs is called gasflit in 2, gezlrofioedo in
6. Consequently the ά 13 11010, 11 would seem, a dialectic variation of ἐ,
Goth. αἰ· ,· 311011 30 ά occasionally occurs also in the Heliand ; balag
for helag 171, 75 σφώ-01. 153, 3; scdn 96, 22. The ei in geis is
another dialectic variety which is quite common in the Low Frank-
ish of Dutch Limburg and in several Saxon (11310013, 0. g. in Twente
and parts os Westphalia. As, however, the stem seems to be ξέστ’
01 ges-ja (on account of hisi in 1), it may be that ei represents the
Umlaut of ἑ, 33 111 literary Dutch; cf. D. 11001, Ε. whole, but D. keil,
E. hail ,· klein alternating with kleen, etymologically E. clean, etc.
Geiso is the plur. genitive, whereas gosfrit is a real compound.
The word is, apparently, allied to Icel. gezlrl, the short ribs, costae.
Hisi in 1 might be compared to M. D. hzjre ‘⁸ torus, 13001103, lacer-
torum torus, holcen, praesecare‚ abscindere partem,’' were it not
that in order to keep up the connexion between the various codices,
we more safely consider hisi to stand for chisi gisi, gisi. As to
cus, which occurs twice 111 7 and 9 (¹), it is clear either that two
1011113, 000 for the hrain, the other sor the short ribs, have been
blended, or that aufredo, etc., in general denotes ‘⁴ excidium,”O. Fris.
gemjfal. F or fredum, fretum we ought to read fredo, fretho, the
um being due to a confusion in the Romanic pronunciation between
o and um. Char in 10, supposing the vowel to be a long 000,
would mean ‘⁴ hair ’'; but it looks more like a mistake. Τ11010 13 3
provoking similarity between clearfn'do in ᾗ 3 os 10, chesfn'do in 6,
and the Ο. Fris. gers-sal, gres-fal, etc., as the technical term
for ‘⁸ excidium ’' and ‘⁸ casus ad terram '' ; see LL. Fris. 87, 30.
The words “ thera thrira domma gerssel ’³ (88, 22) run in Latin thus:
‘⁶ pro trium intestinorum ad terram lapsu ’'; cf. the O. Fris. adjec-
tives gerffallah, garrfallich, · gerrfelle, gresfelle, etc., in Richth.
Glossary. As 1 see no means to discover the true reading' 111 the
variations in the codd. 1 refrain from pronouncing a mone decisive
opinion. Cf. also ἦ 170 below.

ᾗ 1 11. Andeclzabimzus etc., will be treated of presently. The Latin
words‘ ‘plaga ipsa semper currit et ad sanitatem non pervenit ”
must somehow render the term freobleto in 6, sn'oblitto in 10. Btet
answers to A. S. zelat, lividuS, e. g. bletast benna in Cyuewulr’s
Crist, 771 3 blitto is a semin. substantive derived 10 like manner as
Ο. Η. G. blezsza, livor vulneriS, though it may have belonged to the
strong declension; the shortening os ἑ to i is due to the double con-
sonant following, like in D. bitte, heat, from beet, hot; in Ο. H. G.
bittar, A. S. bitter, Goth. baitrs. Bleto stands for bletto ,· the older
stem of both blato and bleto must have been bletja. Freo points to
