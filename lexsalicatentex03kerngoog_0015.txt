INTRODUCTION.

them (Ep. ad Athen„ Spanheim 280) as Σαλίαν ἔθνος. He allowed
them to remain in the country which they occupied, only requir-
ing them to supply him with auxiliary troops (Zosimus, 111.
8). In the Notitia dignit. we find Salii among the auxilia Pala-
tina.

Nothing certain is known oi the history of the Salians before
Ammianus. Gregory οἱ Tours tells us (11. 9) that the Franks (he
always means the Saliari Franks) at one time lived on the bank os
the Rhine. This statement agrees with Zosimus, who says (111. 6)
that the Salians at one time occupied the Batavian island, having
been driven from their proper abode by the Saxons. Some authors
(Grimm, Ledebur‚ Zeus &c.) think that they are the descendants
of the Sigambri, who were transplanted by Tiberius in Β. c. 8. Wat-
terich, ina work specially devoted to this subject (Die Germanen des
Rheins‚ 1872, pt. 1), comes to the same conclusion. He argues
that the Sigambri‚ whom Tiberius removed from their home on the
right bank of the Rhine, were not placed on the Merwede, a stream
and locality near Dordrecht and Zwyndrecht, nor transformed into
the Gugerni, but transplanted to the region now called the Veluwe,
between the Utrecht Vecht and the eastern Yssel. Here the
Romans probably made of them what the Batavi had been for
years past—their allies—perhaps on the same condition as the lat-
ter, who merely furnished the Romans with men and anus3 hence
the Sigambrian cohort in the Thracian war in A. D. 26, 34 years
aster they had been transplanted.

There can be no doubt as to a certain connexion existing between
the Sigambri and Salii: ‘⁴ detonsus Vachalim (the Waal) bibat Si-
camber ” (Sidon. Apollin. carm. 13 v. 31)—“ Ut Salius iam rura
colat flexosque Sicambri In falcem curvent gladios '’ (Claudian
de laude stilic. I. 222)-“ ὣς δὲ καὶ Σνγάμβροις ἐπαγρυπνεῖν ἠπείλει
(θράγγους αὐτοὺς ἐξ ἡγεμόνος καλοῦσιν ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος οἱ περὶ Ῥῆνον
καὶ ‘rosnay ”) (Lydus de Magistr. 111. 56). According to the
Gesta Francorum, c. 1, the Franks at one time inhabited the town
os Sicambria. Franks and Frankish kings are osten called Si·-
gambri, and always with the intention of honoun'ng them. When
St. Remigius baptised Chlovis he exhorted him: ‘⁸ Mitis depone
colla Sicamber ” (Gregor. Tur. II. 3¹)· Venant. Fortun. says to
king Charibert (vi. 4) : ‘⁶ Cum sis progenitus clara de gente Sygam-
ber.'’ For other quotations see Waitz, Verfassungsgesch. H.
22 &c.

In the year 431, the Frankish (Salic) king Chlodio (Chlojo,
Chlogio, qui apud Dispargum castrum habitabat, quod est in ter-
mino Thoringorum, Gregor. Tur. 11. 9), said to be the founder of
the Merovingian dynasty (Gregor. 1. c.), defeats AetiuS, takes Cam-
brai and advances his domain as sar as the Somme (Gregor. ibid.;
Sidon. Apoll. v. 211 ; cf. Idatius Chron. Roncall. 11. 23; Jordan.
de r. g. 34). King Childerich, the father of Chlovis (Chlodovech),
reigned from 4 5 7—48 1, and resided at Toumai‚ where his grave was
discovered in 1653. His son was bomin 466 (Gregor. Turon. 11.
43), and succeeded him in 481 (Gregor. H. 27). Portions os the
Salic empire were at that time govemed by other kings independent
of Chlovis. The career of the latter is well known and is, more·
over, accurately sketched in Richter’s Annalen. whether he ever
was proconsul of the Roman empire, as is usually inferred from the
long Prologue, is a doubtful point in the face of different readings
in other MSS.

The origin of the name SalicuS, Salius is uncertain. It is not im-
possible that it was derived om the river which is now called

Xan-el, and in th'e Middle Ages Jsloa, Hali-loa, Isla, stela, Isalia.
'Ibe region about Deventer, in the east of Holland, is called Sal-

land till the present day, though it is nowhere expressly said that
the Saliam lived there.

Τ11ε codices of the Lex Salica, which have been preserved to us,
may be divided into five classes or families.

As the genealogy of the MSS. is as yet unsettled, 1 have not
thought it prudent to place them in any other order than that
adopted by Merkel. 1t is not impossible, that, when the study of
the Lex Salica has more advanced, this order will have to be
changed. Most of the following MSS. have been described by
Pardessus (Loi Salique, Presace) and in various volumes of the
Mon. Germ. Hist., and 1 refer to these works for further informa·
tion.

FIRST FAMILY.

1. MS. Ne. 4404 Lat„ of the Paris Nat. Library; Fol„ beginning
of the 9th century. Cf. Monum. Germ. Legg. I Praef. XXI; ΙΙ,
pag. 1. 2. 5. 9. ιο; ΠΙ. 2; Pardessus, Loi salique, pres. p. X, who
published it as his first text3 Merkel made it the basis of his
edition and called it cod. 1. It is also taken as the basis of the
present work.

2. Wolfenbiittel, second half os 8th cent. , 8⁰, written by Agam-
bertus (ora pro agambert0, on sol. 87¹²), a monk of Toum, and
preserved in the Ducal Library, where it bears the pressmark
weissenburg, 97, it having belonged to the ancient abbcy of that
name in Alsace. The verso of fol. 13 seems to have been written*
by a different hand. 1t was first published by Echardt in his
Leges Francorum et Ripuariomm. Francos. & Lips. 1720. p.
119-140. Cf. Pardessus, p. 157, who published it as his First
Appendix; it is Merkel’s and codex.

8. Munich, K. Bibl. Cimel. IV. 3 g, about the end of the 8th or
beginning of the 9th cent.. 8⁰. Second Appendix of Pardessus;
Merkel's third text. It formerly belonged to the Church of the
Holy Cross' at Augsburg‚ and was first published by F merbach,
Die Lex Salica und ihre verschiedenen Recensionen. Erlangen‚
183'1. cf. Pardessus‚ p. 193 3 Mon. Germ. Legg. 111. 3.

4. Paris Lat. (formerly suppl. Lat. 65, at present) 9653, 9111 cent„
sm. Fol. Second text of PardessuS. Merkel's 4th text. Cf. Par-
dessus, Pref. XX1V; Mon. Germ. Legg. I. p. XXIV. 111. 50⁹9.

Codd. 1 and 2 contain a great number os the so-called Malberg
Glosses. In cod. 4they occurinTitt. 17 and 35 alone. In cod. 3 they
are found only in a few places, but the scribe, who regarded them
as Greek words, says at the end of the table os rubrics: ‘⁴ Nos
propter prolixitatem voluminis vitandam seu fastidio legentium vel
propter utilitatem intelligendi abstulimus hinc verba Graecorum et
numero dinariorum, quod in ipso libro crebro conscribta inveni-
muS.’'

It is now generally assumed that the above four MSS. contain
the short and oldest redaction of the Lex Salica in 65 chapters, the
first entitled : De mannire ; the last ε De caballo mortuo excorti-
cato. These 65 chapters correspond to the first 68 chapters of the
Lex Emanium* Itis true, cod. 1 presentS, in an almost unbroken

⁸ Ήιο difference of a number of three chapters is caused by the Lex Emen-
data containing a chapter VIII: Defurttlr arborum, which either does not
occur in the oldest texts at all, or, as i· tho case in texts 5 and 6, is united
with ch. VII. The Lex Emend. further contains two chapters XVI and xvn:
De eo qm'vr'llant adanam mallim? and De eo quilmninem mortuum ex-
spoliauerit, which in the older texts are either omitted or combined with ch.
