PRELIMINARY RE MARKS.

ὁ 1. HE Frankish elementa in the Salic Law have never ceased
to attract the attention of the students of mediaeval law(¹). Still
higher do they rank in the estimation of philologistS, especially
those who occupy themselves with the study of the Teutonic
languages. And deservedly so, for the little scraps of Frankish
which occur here and there in the various texts of the Lex Salica,
are the chief source for our knowledge of that language. There
are no poemS, no translations of the Gospels, nor any other literary
remains of the period when a part of the Salian Franks settled in
Gaul. The numerous proper names known to us from charters,
show too much os the influence of the prevailing Romanic tongue
os Gaul to be os great use (²). The French words, derived from a
Teutonic source, when reconstrued into their ancient form, seldom
enable us to pronounce upon their specifically Frankish character;
they may have been borrowed from Burgundian, Gothic, Rhine-
srankish, Alamanic, not to speak of such words as had already
passed into Latin before it broke up into distinct dialects.

The Salic Law possesseS, accordingly, an interest of its own
such as'it would hardly claim ir we had more or less copious texts
of another kind at our disposal. In the latter case, indeed, sew
persons would care, at least for linguistic purposes, to study a
document abounding with difficulties of all sortS.

ᾖ 2. Our first and greatest difficulty is the sad condition of the
codices. Grimm, whose preface to Merkel’s edition of the Lex
(Berlin, 1850) marks an epoch in the elucidation of the so-called
Malberg Glosses, has justly observed that a compar-ison of the
various readings of the glosses makes it at once evident that they
are disfigured ¹to such an extent as to make one despair, after
repeated fruitless endeavours, os penetrating to the meaning of
the words (³). To this he adds: “If the Salic Law sprung into
existence in the 5th century, and if no manuscripts of it anterior to
the 8th and 9th have been preserved, the gradual decline, even in
the Merovingian period, of the Teutonic tongue as distinguished
from the Romanic, must render it conceivable how the scribeS,
mostly os Latin training, became more and more ignorant of the Frank
terms, and transmitted the text disiigured, confused and mutilated.”

(¹) 1t will suffice to mention the comparatively recent publications of
Prof. R. Sohm, der Procesz der Lex Sala‘ca (1867), and Die Fra'nkae'sche
Besilus-und Genkktsverfassung (1871).

(²) A careful study of those proper names may, however, lead to some
valuable results. M. d'Arbois de Jubainville has given a convincing proof of
it in 1115 able paper: E tude surla de‘clinaiwn des nones pmjres dans la langue

ome xxxi .

The ignorance and carelessness of the scribes has not been
exaggerated by Grimm. This will be readily admitted by all who
have studied the subject. Grimm’s statement requires no limi-
tation, but, on the contrary, a greater extension. Our codices of
the Lex Salica, if superlatively bad as regards the Frank termS, are
but little better in the Latin or rather semi-Latin part. It is
not too much to say that they are carelessly written, corrupt and
vitiated, in fact untrustworthy in every respect. Suppose we had
no continuous text aud came across a Latin honocolatus (¹), then we
should hesitate as to the word intended; and even after finding it
out, still continue to doubt whether in any dialect or any period
honocolatus had really been in use.

A remarkable instance of the untrustworthiness of the MSS. is
afforded by the various readings in Tit. XLVII. There we find
in 1, one of the oldest codices„ instead of si citra Ltheri(m) aut
Carbonariam an utterly meaningless sic elzjgere aut carbonariam.
Another (6) exhibits : sic inter allzjgare aut carbonarius, which
should be: sic intra szgerem et Carbonarias. A third (3) vitiates
the whole passage by introducing a would-be correction, and has:
si citra mare aut carbonaria. To find out the original text seems
well-nigh impossible ; upon the basis of the different codices the
only justifiable inference 15, 55 far as 1 can see, that the readings
are reducible to two, viz. , si citra (al. intra) Legerem (Ligerim)
aut Carbonarianr.

, 111 general it may be asserted that the errors and peculiarities in

the writing of the Latin text find their counterparts in the glosseS.
Thus there is a regular confusion of the Latin endings um, o and
us, whence we may infer that all three were pronounced alike or
nearly 5ο, viz. as ο. Instances of this confusion, which is natural
and to a certain extent quite allowable in the semi-Latin of the
Lex, but preposterous in Frankish wordS, are far from scarce. In
Tit. ΙΙ. § 1, where 2 has calcio, 1 shows calcium. Such an im-
possible um for ο 15 the first step in a wrong direction; subsequent
scribes will take a second step and change um, letus say, into iim.
In this way arose the monstrous leciim of cod. 2 in Tit. XXXV
for leto. '

It cannot be called an error when, in the idiom os the Lex, the
Latin spoliare becomes expoliare, but it is decidedly wrong when
a Frank scuto is written excute, for in the one case it is only a
symptom of the growing development of Latin into French, in the
other we have evidence of the scribe being wholly unacquainted
with any Teutonic language.
