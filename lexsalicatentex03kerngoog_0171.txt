NOTES. TITT. XIII. XIV.

188, 1. There isno difficulty in taking theo in the sense of ‘⁴ puella,’'
though in the cognate languages it appears as ‘⁴ aneilla,” for
theo is properly “a girl,” like O. S. thoma, O. H. G. diurna
‘⁶ virgo, puella,” and “famula,” but 0. N. perna, exclusively “a
maid-servant.” A greater difficulty lies in andra, which can never
mean “ aliena,” but only ‘⁸ alia.'’ To remove the difficulty we should
read andrus the0, O. Η. G. andrus (al. andr-es) thiu, another’s
girl.

Less ambiguous, and therefore preferable, is the term anestet in
6, anastheo in 10, slightly corrupt for aneflet, anafteo. A antet is
the p. p. p. of a verb *anestian (= anehtian) and materially the
same as an afteo or perhaps an adj. anasti = O. S. anehti, sponsa
(Hel. 15, 15 Cotton.; ancleti 83, 4 Monac. 3 an ehti Cotton.); syno-
nymous are anthelm· and antheri. For the ft = ht, cf. O. Fris. ast,
eft ; aflagia, to wed; aflinge, matrimonium.

Antedio in 2 is, of course, wrong; read ante-etth a Ο. S. anthehti ;
eht and heht are constantly confused.

ὖ 83. Dructe (pron. (ἰν-κώεα), dructi, ἀντιάει, dmchte, druthe
(= dmhte), in§ 14 of 6, δια, is the instrum. c. of drucht (stem
ἀγυι-Μὴ, 3 company, train. It here denotes either the bridal train,
Ο. Fris. drecht, or, if taken in a concrete sense, what in O. H. G. is
called nithagome, tar-uhtiug, paranymphus; cf. Slavonic druz'ba,
dmz‘ka, druz'ban, dmg (¹). It is interesting to compare the follow-
ing passages in the Frisian Laws (p. 52, Richth.): “jes ther tuene
brothere send end thi other wif halat ti hove and ti hfise mith dome
and mith drechte'’; and p. 98: “huersa ma hir ene frowe halleth
mit horn ande mit hlud, mit doem anda mit drechte.”

§ 84. Changichaldo in 10, (gaugeclmldo, gaugecaldo read) gunge-
chaldo in 7, 8, 9 is rendered by “ in via adsalierit.” Gange, changi,
answers to Ο. H. G. gang, the plural of which is gengi, genge‚ N. H. G.
gaug, gange, and to O. Fn's. genae (s. Graff, Spr. IV, 99, and Richth.
gloss. i. v. genze). Chaldo is Ο. H. G. balta, impedimentum, be it
the nomin. or any other case of the singular. Gangichaldo conse-
quently is ‘⁴ marring the way, impeding one in going.” For gaug-ie-
altha in 6 read gangra-(maltha. The th instead of d is a counter·
part of such F rankish spellings as ser-tbi forferdi, Ps. 73, 5 ς 64, 9,
and the nth ε nd in the present participle.

ᾗ 8 5. For anthzfaltlu'o in 1 I propose to read anchzfarthio (-- an·-
ngardio), a nom. act. of a verb ancha-‘sartha = Ο. Η. G. anagi-
ίαν-τῶι, impetere (Graii, Spr. ΙΙΙ, 589). ΑηεΙιζῙὶινίΙιιὶ), or in nom. c.
perhaps —tlu‘, impetus, would appropriately express the “ super-
ventus ’¹ of the text. It is scarcely necessary to observe that lt, st,
rt, ft are easily confused.

ὁ 86. Entirely different from anchtfanhi(o), impetuS, superventus,
is the word used to express what in the semi-Latin of the Lex is
called expoliatio (²), viz. murdo in 2. This is a semim, the stem of
which is mur-daz, mut-dja. Murrio, whether it be a nom. c. analo·
gons to A. S. hyldo, etc., or an oblique case, alternates with mardi
or mor-di, which is intended in Tit. XXXV, where modi of 7, 8, 9
is a clerical error for mordi. Murdo, mor-di (older form murdia,
mordt'a) answers to M. D. femin. mort (mord), which sometimes

signifies murder, but more often a heinous crime in general (see de
VrieS, Lekenspiegel, Gloss. i. v.). Cod. 2 also writes musdo in
Tit. XXXV, and muther in Tit. LV. The latter corrupt reading
points to marthe or murther, A. S. moroor, morour, E. murder
rather than to munio, but this is an additional reason to convince
us that thesin musdo is wrong, notwithstanding the frequent oecur-
rence of musido, mosido, mos-edo in 6, 10, 7, 8, 9. It proves against
6 that it has mundo in § 103 for mundo may easily arise, by mis-
take, out of mur-do or mundo, but hardly out of must'do. The
evidence of 7, 8, 9 is valueless; 1⁶ because they write modi else-
where, which is clearly a mistake for, or a bad pronunciation of,
mor-di, not of mosido ,· and 2⁰ on account of their own distinct νά
in Tit. LV. As to ιο, this cod. has regularly s, both in mosedo and
moseia. The latter, as well as musdo of ι in Tit. XXXV, iswholly
out of the question, because it is phonetically inadmissible. The
conclusion we arrive at is that murdo of 2 is right, and that mosido,
tumido, musdo are alterations of, or perhaps would-be emendations
for, mordio, murdz'o, murdo. Grimm (Pref. XLIV) prefers musido,
deriving it from a supposed mosian, musian, N. H. G. mausen,
suffurari. He had expressed a contrary opinion in his G. D. Spr-
(p. 390), where he said that it would be “ silly ’⁹ to have recourse to
N. H. G. mausen. To me it would seem that the existence of some
verb like miusan or musian might have been defended by appeal to
Skr. musb, to steal, but this is not the question. What we have
to decide in the first place is whether a critical comparison of the
various readings allow us to see in mosido, musido, genuine words,
by the side of an equally genuine mut-do. The answer has been
given above.

In order fully to understand the purport of the term, we should
bear in mind that murdio expresses the idea of a clandestine mis-
deed, be it killing or otherwise, e. g. M. D. marthrant, N. H. G.
mordbrand, etc. The sense attached to O. N. myri5a is strikingly
illustrated by such passages as in Volsunga Saga 1: “Pa kemr
upp, at Sigi hefir drepit praelinn ok myroanss' In the Oxf. Dict. i. v.
moris, it is said, “ To slay a man asleep or feloniously was also
called mor6.’' Is it not evident that, when we find in the Lex
Salica “ si quis hominem donnientem expoliaverit '’ with the Malb.
sreomundo, alternating in the same codex with clareamus-ida,
nothing is meant but hreomurdo, chreumurdio, and that “mor-
tuum expoliare '’ is exactly the O. N. ἀνέρα einan ok myroa ἒ

Ῐ find another indirect proof that mut-dio, mur-do is the genuine
term, in the Ο. S. walddd. This, like M. D. mort, means “a
heinous crime,” and is apparently connected with wal, A. S. ποιεί,
strageS, mors; etc. In the same manner as walddd comes to
express a very grave delict, a capital crime, so too murdio has the
same meaning.

Ι dare not assert that the semi-Latin “expoliatio” is a happy
rendering of murdio. Some doubt will be allowed is we compare
the tenor of ἦ 2 in 2 with ς 3 of Tit. XVI in the same codex. In
the former passage there seems to be question of morb‘, mort, in the
same way as we find it used in Ο. N. and M. D.; in the latter
passage more particularly of mordbrand.

ἦ 87. Alag, alach, ala (for alah, like Chlowi(s) for -wih = ung),
is rendered by an ambiguous “villa” It rather seems to be “a
farm” than “a village,'' but the Lex confounds it with thurp.
Grimm identifies it with O. S. alah, Goth. allas, A. S. ealh, tem-
plum, and strengthens his etymology by referring to A. S. ealgian,
tueri, defendere. This etymology may or may not be right, but it
leaves us in the dark about the exact meaning of the word as a
forensic term.
