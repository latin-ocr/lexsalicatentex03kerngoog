NOTES. TIT. XVII.

freho, ferekw, A. S. seorh, Ο. S. serub, ferh, sera ; Goth. fairh-
wus, etc. Freoblt'tto, -bleto virtually answers to A. S. seorhben in
seorhbennum sedc, Beowuls, 2740.

ξ 1 12. Andechabinus in 2 means leandeclzafinus, as is proved bycan-
dechapanus (read chandechaphanus) in 4. It is asubstantive derived
with Goth. suffix (massus, A. S. (n)ess, O. S. (n)uss, F rankish mess
of the Psalms and Gl. L., etc„ from handekafan, D. handhaven ,-
cs. French maintenir, Spanish mantener, and (as regards the end-
ing) A. S. ahusenes, O. H. G. bikabannissi, and the like. Such
substantives in nassas are co·ordinate formations with verbs in
inon, as Goth. skalkinassus, skalkinon, etc„ and in so sar hande-
havinus, kundekafanus might be said to be direetly derived from
handehabindn, -ltafandn, and indirectly from haban. In Dutch
occurs handhavenen, to leech, along with handlzaven, to main·
tain (¹). We learn from the Lex that with the Franks also
haudehafinus meant “ medicatum,” i. e. the expenses for the cure.
In 6 and ιο the term has been misplaced ς it should have come
in ὖ 7, &c. We should read in 6 haudehafen, in 10 handekasenus;
the former is a legitimate variation, and a substantive directly
derived from haudehafan (a verb os the ai class) with the common
suffix nia.

θ 1 13. The slightly varying terms expressing beating with a club
or stick are compounds, the former part of which is at one time
wal, at another time widi or wado, wad, wald. Wal is Goth.
walus, O. Fris, walu, wale, wal (in walubera), Ο. N. vb'lr, a stick.
Synonymous with it is mili sor wt'clu, A. S. wudu, O. H. G. wita,
wood; M. D. wede, virga. Both words recur as synonymous in
the Ο. Η. G. terms walaworf (i. e. waleworf) and ποίησον] in the
Lex Bajwar. ς S. Ducange i. vv. and cf. the Langobardic wala-
paus. It is not easy to say whether wald and wad must be looked
upon as other synonymous substitute& Wald, indeed, is scarcely
distinguished from wal, in so sar as wood, a piece of wood, and a
stick, are cognate notions ; and since wala is synonymous with wida,
and on the other hand widu with wald, as we perceive e. g. in.
O. H. G. waltgfalcho = wite-salcho (Graii, Spr. 111, 498), it follows
that in the Malberg also wald may be taken in the sense of a piece
of wood, a club. It cannot be denied that wado may be a badly-
pronounced waldo, but if we suppose an error in the pronunciation
or writing, we may as well think of waldo being a corruption of
wando, Goth. wandus, O. N. vb'ndr, E. wand ,· cf. especially Ο. N.
vwdar-hb'gg, a wand-stroke, flogging (s. Oxf. Dict. i. v. vo'ndr).
Ι really think thatin some cases the parent of wado, wad, is wandus,
a wand, but as we find wude, wald, and wal also in another con-
nexion, viz„ as making part of a word expressive of “ beating with
the fist,” clausa manu, clauso pollice or pugno, we must necessarily
come to the conclusion either that the term is misplaced or that
two similar words have been mixed together. Where wad0, wade
appears in connexion with the fist, it may more properly have
been the equivalent os O. N. vb'dvi‚ whence vb‘dva-sdr, explained to
be “a fleshwound,” Gragas 11, 18 (²) 3 vb'dva-skez'na (Oxf. Dict.

· 721). The Ο. F ris· terms for the delict in question are even more ι

variable, and to no small degree visibly influenced and altered by
popular etymology, for how else shall we account for wedling and
wednelsa interchanging with wonnelsa (see Fris. LL. 212, 16, and
333, 18)? Somehow or other there certainly is some relation be-

hamen.”

tween the Ο. Fris. wedne sleka (Fris. LL. 121, 10) and wadeflat in
2, waldphalt in 6. Ι 'shall not enter into any speculation about the
connexion between wado, as well as wi'du, and Skr. wadha,
because it wo⁶uld be out os place and rather tend to entangle
matters than otherwise. ⁸

The second part of the compound, flat, and by metathesis

phalthw, faltho, salta, phalt, stands for flaht, salhteo, falhto, ·

fallit. It is a derivative from a verb *stabam Ο. Ν. fla', A. S.
flean, M.D. vlaen, E. to flay ; to the same radical belong O.N.flagna,
to flake off (s. Oxf. Dict.), and E. to stay. Allied to it is O. H. G.
fillsan, fillan, percutere, flagellare, verberare, F rankish of the
Psalms (belfillan, flagellare, D. villcn, to flay. To the F rankish
flat, i. e. flaht, answers exactly the Ο. Fris· fleht, flecht (for
flahti) in offlecht, synonymous with ofsleclz ; e. g. Fris, LL. 32,
one text has : ‘⁴ neiles qfslech fiwer enza; selles ofslec alsa fule ” ς
the other: “ neiles offlecbt fiuwer enza; selles qfflecltt alsa felo.”
The Latin translator, to whom the antiquated word was not very
clear, had recourse to etymology, and renders it by: “ unguis
effugium (!) quatuor unciae; pro pellis effugio (ἔ) quatuor unciae.”
He took stocht, i. e. flachtz, sor flecht, i. e. fluhti, flight. It
is but sair to add that his error proves most useful to our purpose,
for it shows that the reading of the MSS. is beyond doubt. Ι
need not point out how near qfflecht is allied to 0. N. stagna, to
flake off. .

Fach in 1 is undoubtedly wrong, but whether it represents a
legitimate form flach :flah, derived like Goth. slahs, etc„ or
should be flatlz = flaht, cannot be made out. F or sodo in 2, soth in
1, we probably should read flodo (for flogitho), floth ,· the vowel
agrees with that in E. to flog.

Uuea adepaltheo in 6 has arisen from a combination of, two
readingS, a fact which we have repeatedly had occasion to observe in
that codex. The parent of the MSS. showed‚ it may be surmised,

something like ² Z‘ezgfcphaltheo. The upper w, aster having been

mistaken for m, was subsequently expressed by a contraction.

ᾗ 1 14. The text of ὁ 9 cannot be anaccurate rendering of the original
law. For what has an attempt at spoliation to do in this Title?
Our doubt is increased by the Malberg in 2 having murdo, in 6
merda, read murdo, in ὖ 11 of 10 mosd0, read mordo ,· cs. Notes
to Tit. XIV. The grave delict, so termed, seems to be that of a
treacherous assault on the highway, with weapons in hand; hence
the large amount os the fine, being as high as in the two first ἕξ
of the Title. That ὁ 12 in 6 and the corresponding ones in ιο are
a later addition, we infer from two circumstances ; first, because a·
special T itle, LXI, treats of harawarw, chaeroenO, chereno ,· and
secondly because it is preposterous that one should have to pay
62⁴} solidi for an attempt, and only 30 solidi for the act of robbing.
The very form in which hamwano here appears shows that the ὖ is
taken from another source than that from which the bulk os 6 is
derived, the same codex having camerano in Tit. LXI. More about
harumna will be found in the Notes to the said Title.

ἑ 115. Entirely different from the Malb. in 2, 6 and ιο is the one
we find in 1, namely, urtzfugia. As the text has “ per fugam
evaserit,” the word intended must be untflugia, escape by ssight,
from unssiokan, D. ontvlien, Goth. unpassiuhan, O. H. G. int-
fliakan, etc„ to escape by ssight. A feminine untflugia is not
known from other sourceS, but justifiable as the counterpart to the
Ο. N. neuter flug=fl6tti, ssight. Fluga'a may also represent the
dative os a neuter or masculine ja- stem: as such it occurs Gl.
