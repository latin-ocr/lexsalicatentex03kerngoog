NOTES. CHUNNAS.

is kann-malastih, A. S. kundtwelftng. The corresponding Ο. Fris.
term is ²⁰{fffg without hund prefixed. Below we see the word,
which is here written thoalas, corrupted into theuvualt and tuuwalt,
with a would-be correction thuuualt, a sufficient proof that the
scribes had not the slightest notion of the existence of such a word
as “ twelve.’'

2. Sexan is an impossible form, at least for the nominative, there
being nothing like it in any Aryan tongue; we ought to read sex
or sexiu chunna ; the latter in case chunna be a genitive pl„ which
is probable. At first sight chunna would seem to be identical with
Goth. hunda, but the Frankish numbers show a far advanced state
of phonetical decay; and it is, therefore, more than improbable that
the plural of a neuter chunn would deviate from the form common
to all Teutonic dialects, Gothic excepted. In other ποιᾶς, the nom.
pl. of a neuter chunn must have been chunn = A. S. hund.

3. Septun lookS, at first sight, very archaic‚ and reminds us of

Lithuanian septyni. On closer inspection we feel some doubts as to
the correctness os this identification. From the Goth. sibun we
must infer that the prehistoric Teutonic form of the word was
sibdun. In short, septun, and further on septen, are one more
instance of the tendency to give to Frank. words a Latin tinge. We
should read sepham, sefun.

4. Instead of the corrupt theuvualt, etc„ the approximately cor-
rect formis troals, Goth. twalzf, D. maalf, twelve.

5 St. 6. For tbue septen read tui (i. e. twi) -sgplmn (sesun)‚ i. e.
twice seven ; for theu vuenet, theuuene: tui-neum, i. e. twice nine.
cf. the Ο. Fris. expression twia niugun (Fris. LL. 120, 6; 13. 536,
4). th' is O. Fris. troi in twi-bde ,· 0. Ν. tvi, O. H. G. ποί and
srvi, etc. Neune stands nearer to Ο. H. G. niun (niani), Goth.
niun, Ο. Ν. niu, than to Ο. S. mgun (rugum), A. S. mgron, D.
negen, O. Fris. mjgun, ningen, along with πίση in niontich.

7—9. Thotocondi thothocundi is a corrupted mmm-andi, tutha·
sondi‚· cf. A. S. tac-hund. As to the final i cf. Ο. S. (fif) tha-
sundig. In my opinion m-thasundi is the earliest instance known
of the word “thousand ’⁹ being indeclinable when combined with
a preceding cardinal. The same principle is followed by Ο. Η. G.
in such combinations as drio stunt, fins stunt, sibun stunt, etc„
where the femin. stunt remains unchanged.

Fitme, vueth are meaningless; a word fimte for fimfti, O. N.
finnt, a pentad, is imaginable. As we meet below with an impos-
sible fitter instead offiuer, four, there is little doubt that fitme is a
mere misreading for firme, Ο. Η. G. vin-vi, O. S. flvi, five. The
other reading vuetlz points to something like vach, vich, viis, A. S.
fls, D. vtjff, etc. (cf. Tit. LXIV).

For fit tertius chunde, fit ternu sundo in which the scribes evi-
dently recognized the Latin words fit and tertius, we ought to read

finer-thumnde (better fiwer-thdsundi), four-thousand. Fiwer stands

next to Ο. S. fiuuar. The numeral following, eight thousand, ought
to be acto-thosande. Aeto, i. e. achto, is Ο. S. ahto, Ο. H. G. αΙιεό,
A. S. eahta, Ο. Fris. achta. A form thuschunde for tkmnde is
problematic though possible on account of Ο. N. pnlslumd and
pu'shundra& (s. Oxf. Dict. i. vv.).

10 δι 11. The words expressive of the numbers 2400 and 3200
have sadly suffered at the hands of the scribes, The approximately
correct readings will be: τὴν-ὡ stunde takteto (tahteh) chunna,
Ο. Η. G. drio stunt ahtozug (ahtozo, abug) hunt ; and finer stunde
tameo (tabteh) chunna, four timffl eighty hundred. · Tahtetoh (?),
tahteh is M. D. tachtech, N. D. tachtr'g, O. Fris. nemag, Ο. S.
antahtoda. Similar instances of multiplicatiori are afforded by
the Frisian Laws; e. g„ twia sexticlc sminge, chria seat-lidi skil-
linga, sex stunda sextich skillinga (Fris. LL. 127) ; cf. such phrases
as “ in triplum mccc dinarios '⁹ in the Lex itself.
