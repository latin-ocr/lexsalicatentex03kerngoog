fied shows that leodardi is required, just as in the other codd.

Antedio in ᾗ 3 os 1 and 2 must be taken in its etymological sense
os “ effractura,'' otherwise it is misplaced ; for technically it denotes a
fine of the fixed amount of 18ood. The text os 11109111 115 corrupt;
the words “si effracturam fecerit quod valet 11 din.” having no
sense. There is no doubt that untedio is wanting where it ought to
stand, namely in ὖ 5. ·

For anorlenet antheodio in 6, norchlotin 8 and 9, norchot in 7, an·

theoco in 8, anthedio 111 7, 1 propose to read avorsclute: untedio ,-
avom-chlot, a. Avorsclute or avorschlot is materially the same as
O. H. G. astersluzel, “adulterina clavis ’² (Graff, Spr. VI, 815), for
ανον, M. D. aver, N. H. G. aber, do‘es not materially differ from aster;
cf. such words as N. H. G. aber-witz and afterwitz ‚· Μ. Ι). avem-'725
and averwz'ttng, insipiens (5. Κ11. 1. v.). Sclot or sclute (the latter a
stem in i ,· cs. Ο. N. hlutr, plur. hlutir and hlotar ; N. H. G. schluss),
M. D.slot, “sera‚ claustrum ferreum,” serves the same purpose as
sclutil, slutz’l, a key. The Latin text distinctly says ‘⁴ si clavem
adulteravit,” and this agrees very well with avorsclot. 1 am at 3
1055 10 account for the eo in antheodiO, and for the whole word
antheoco. Perhaps two readings have got mixed up, the one being
antediO, the other some derivative from a verb signifying to open,
say, anthleedia‚ from Ο. S. anthlidan, A. S. embadon, recludere,
010., or antscleot (¹), from antscleotau, O. H. G. antsleozan, insleozan,
N. D. ontslm'ten, to unlock. The scl in the Frank. word needs no
comment3 it is well known from sclot in Gl. L. 800, from Ο. Fris.
skluta, etc.

XII.

ᾗ 76. Falcono may be some case of salchon (sulgon), the nom.
actionis ossalchon or falgian, plagiare, or to purloin; cf. alfalchio
111 Τ11. X and cf. Tit. XXXIX. Such a term does not seem very ap-
propriate, though it may not be wholly inadmissible. One would
rather expect a term sor flogging, answering to the “ flagelli ” of
the Latin text. Now, O. N. fld, M. D. vlaeyen, vlam, vlaeghen,
E. to stay, is synonymous with D. vium, Ο. Η. G. fillan. Just as
from the latter filla, flagellum is derived, so from the former may be
formed flacha, flaga, the genit. plur. os which will be flachono,
stagono, precisely like fillono, verberum, in O. H. G. (Graff, Spr.
ΙΙΙ, 471). The genit. c. is required owing to the preceding noun
os number, 120.

ᾗ 77. Schodo, which stands wholly isolated in 1, is, in my opinion,
a mistake for schola, an oblique 0350, or a vicarious form, of schola,
M. D. schole, A. S. scolu, caterva (E. skaal). It 15, 111 3 more

. restricted sense, a gang of three men, and as such used technically

and elliptically in the Lex to express what in A. S. is called laos-
bat (Latinized hlossbota), LL. Aelfr. ἦ 29, sqq.‚ except the difference
in the number of men in a Ιιίἂδ and 3 schola. The addition os
schole tends to show that each person has to pay his share in the
whole fine3 cs. the wording of the A. S. Laws, in Latin translation.

‘si quis twihindum- cum lame, i. e. cohorte, occidat, reddat qui
ictum confitebitur weram et witam (¹), et omnir qui mtetfuerit
reddat xxx sol. pro blo&- bota,'' with that of our Lex.

ᾗ 78. Malzantania 111 2 15 corrupt· , read amala, amtanza. Smala 15
a maiden, especially a “ puella ingenua ’⁹ ; 500 above ᾇ 72; amsani is
“ancilla,” but also a girl or woman skilled in haudiwork. That
the latter is here meant appears from the addition “de screona’'
111 111051 codd„ for screuna is, what otherwise in Ο. Η. G. is called
tunc, i. e. textrina, 3 workshop3 s. Ducange i. v. The word is
generally supposed to have been derived from Latin scrinium,
though it 1135 never been explained for what reason the Franks
should have changed the gender. I do not regard screona as a
Latin word. That the A. S. scrin, a shrine, N. H. G. schrein,
E. shrine, and even O. Fris. skrin, skren, are (111-0011)1 bon-owed
from the Latin 1 readily admit (ἲ), 11111 Ι doubt the Latin origin os
E. to screen.

§ 79. A lteqfaltheo 111 6 15 a perfect riddle to me. Altheo may signisy
“ aliena puella ''; for al, Goth. ana-, A. S. oele, ele, el, 010., 15 “ 311115,”
and in 3 compound also “another's”; theo, Goth. piwi, etc. is a
girl. Falcheo, is it be = falchz'o, is, as we have seen, ‘⁸ seducing.”
Now there is 110 distinct word here in the Latin text for ‘⁸ aliena,”
which occurs in ᾗ 9 of 1 and 6, ᾗ 7 of 7, 8, 9. The gloss is pro-
bably misplaced and should have been put in ᾗ 12 as a variantes
anestet.

ὖ 80. Os Itonema in 6, bonomo and onemo in 10, bonimo (read ho-
nimo) in 7, 8, 9, ko stands for hjo, kz'o, hiu, Ο. N. hju', man and wife,
household3 essentially the same is O. S. hiwa, conjux, etc. The
transition of 11εά 11110 ho finds its counterpart in M. D. Itou-
weltsjk (along with huwelzjk), marriage, houwbaer, 010., and in Dan.
and Sued. hos = O. N. hjd, not to mention a number os other in·
stances where Norse and Frisian, more than any other Teutonic
languages‚ show the elision os 3 j. Nemo (nimo) as well as nomo,
can mean “ 3 taker,” like 0. Η. G. nemo and nomo, 0. g. in n'ge-
nemo, victor; erbinomo, haeres (Graff, Spr. II, 1074); or “a
taking '⁹ like O. H. G. sigenomo, victoria ; the final a in honema 15
1101 strange. The reason that honemo was used in the Salic Law
as a term for a lower sort os marriage may be that neman was
osten, though not necessarily, used in the sense of taking by force.

ᾗ 81. Ansamia in6reminds us of O. S. semea, sehmea and fadmia
(Hel. 9 and 174). This, however, is not sufficient to suggest a
plausible explanation os the isolated glosS, the true reading of which,
uncorroborated as it is by other evidence, is far from certain.

ὁ 82. A ndra theo in 8, corrupted to andrateo in 7 and andra tho in
9, is literally O. H. G. andra (andem) thiu “ aliam ancillam,” the
nomin. os which ander thiu, alia ancilla, occurs Tatian (ed. Sievers)
