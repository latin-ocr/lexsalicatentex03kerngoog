NOTES. TIT. 111.-

pedero in 10, protero (read prothero ?) in 2. Grimm (Pref. XX) with
some plausibility suggests a connexion with Skr. prthuka, a young
animal, and Gr. πόρτις, κόρη-αξ, reprimor. Unsortunately there
is nothing in the Teutonic languages, as sar as I know, that could
throw light on the Frank. word. Whether it may or may not
claim a distant relationship to Icel. ῥῶ, a small boy (s, Jonsson
Ordb. i. v.) I am not prepared to decide. It is just possible,
though far from evident, that pordor, etc., is akin to O. Η. G. coner,
chorder, quorter, grex (Graff‚ Spr. IV, 490), A. S. corbor, just as
Plattdeutsch podder, D. posen seems to be a mere variety of
N. H. G. kb'der, M. H. G. querder, korder, kerder, O. H. G.
querder, a bait; 50, too, M. D. keuteren, koteren, is a twin form of
N. D. peuteren and M. D. poyeren (for podere-n), to fumble‚ to
finger; cf. Kil. i. vv. Irather think that the various readings os the
codd. point to another word, viz. A. S. hryfier, Ιινίδεν, ἂηῶεν,
kroner, a cow, or a heifer3 O. Fris. hn'ther, breder, and its semin.
in N. Fris. riere (sor fidere), akin to Ο. Η. G. hn'nd, rind, D.
rund and rander. But this explanation will seem rather bold, as
it may be urged that, however ‘slight may be the authority os each
codex, if taken singly, their united agreement in showing a p as
initial letter carries too much weight to allow us to make any
change in that letter. Yet it will be admitted that the letters R
and P are liable to be confused, and that brother = bronder, hreder
is the very term we should expect (cf. the note on pondero in
Tit. XXXVIII). About the declension os the word in question it
is unsase to affirm anything.

9 31. Freodo in 10 goes sar to prove that in 7, 8, 9 not a ch, but a th
is required. The true reading then will be sn'th, friotlw, freodo.
This I consider to be Ο. N. hreoi, abull (s, Oxs. Dict. i. v.).· Frand
Ιιν are often consounded in the Malberg‚ either by mistake or idioma-
tically 3 we have had an instance of it in franne for branuc, and we
meet with another in frio for Ῑινέο (cod. 7, Tit. XV, 9 5, col. 87).
The eo along with i in the word causes some difficulty, sor, is the
Frank. word really agrees with the O. N. word, the final 0 will be
the ending of the weak masc. and such an 0 has not the power os
modifying a preceding vowel i or e into a middle sound between e
and 0,· at least Ι can produce no example os such a change; cs„
however, the A. S. forms freofiian ς Ῑήδίαη ,· freooa.

9 32· A “bimum aut anniculum animal” is called ,τεοῖο in 1,
scedo in 2. The resemblance between both readings is so close
that we cannot help surmising that they contain essentially the
same word, and that somehow there must be an error. I suspect
that we must read scoto, scotta, or seoda, connecting it with the
dialectic (South Holland) D. schot, a young cow between two or
three years old.

9 33. In 6 and 10 we find a distinction made between an ⁴· annicula-
tum ’' and a ‘⁴ bimum animal ”3 this however is wrong, sor ingymis
pondera, gymis· pedero cannot exactly express ‘⁴ bimum,” nor can
‘⁴ anniculatum ” be equivalent to ocsteorci‚ ochsaiora (read oclus-tior-
ci ‚· i. e. ochs ÷ steorci) . Steorci is A. S. stiorc, styrc‚ stirc, a
calf‚ a cow between one and two years old, vitulus, juvencus: Scotch
stirk. sterk, a bullock‚ a heiser between one and two years old: s.
Bosw. A. D. i. v. and cs. styrie in St. Luke, 15, 23 : dn faett styrie.
A decided femin. is M. D. stin-ik (s. Kil. i. v.). If ocs, ocks has
been rightly added—which there is no reason to doubt—the pur-
pose os the addition must have been to distinguish the masc. from
the semin. because the simple steorci would have been ambiguouS.
Considering the tenor os the Lat. text, we arrive at the conclusion
that the translators have failed in determining the exact meaning of
the original Frank. names of various descriptions of neat. Hence the

449

confusion and inconsistencies in the codices, A more accurate
rendering of ingymis pondero, al. gymis pedere, would be ‘⁴ annicu-
latum animal ”; in E. we say a year-ling, in Ο. N. vetrungr, in D.
ewinter, enter, i.e. an animal (cow) between one and two winters
(years old.

' The} proper expression sor “bimum animal’' occurs in 7, 8, 9,
where thinzimus podor (por-dor) is an error for thuigimus p. For
gimus S. 9 133 thui is a bad, but not uncommon, spelling for tui
(i.e. tvm) ; cf. thuihbbdig (Gl. A. 4 in Heyne, Kl. D.) As to the
whole compound cs. A. S. dn pn'wintre Ιινγδεν, a heifer of three
winters (years) ; s. Bosw. A. D. i. v. hryb‘er.

9 34. The addition of malla in 10, mala in 6, is an anticipation os
the next § and in flagrant contradiction to the fine mentioned there.
As it now standS, the fine for stealing a mulia, mala would be
6ood. and 1200d. at the same time.

Malia, mala is clearly D. maal, Gueldrian dial. nuile, a young
cow that has not yet calved, either owing to its youth or else to
exceptional weakuess, In most cases„ then, a nuile will be a year·
ling, but there are also males of two years, In so sar there is no
objection to its being identified with an ingymus (gymis) as well as
a tuigimus p., but undoubtedly the rendering “vacca sine vitulo ’'
is the better; the other rendering ‘⁴ vacca cum vitulo ” is wholly
wrong. The second maia in 6 is, of course, an error for mala or
mulia.

9 35. The expression “vacca domita ” in 6 and 10 answers to “vacca
cum vitulo '’ in the other codd. Hence we have to take ⁴⁴ domita ”
in the sense of ‘⁴ subdued by the bull ”; cs. the use of Gr. δαμείω,
ἀδμής and ἅδμητος. The Malb. chanzyn ponderas in 6 is a curious
corruption of thuagym pondero, which is a mere variety os thuigimus
p. in 7, 8, 9. Stin worse is abazym pedero, read thuagym p. in 10.
The corruption has not unlikely gone through the following stages:
(thau), tuba, taba, taba, aba. The dropping of the initial t finds
its counterpart in ahelepte read thualepti of the same MS. Tit. 11,
mentioned above. A third example is afforded by exachalt for
texaclza; s. 9 29. For gym one would expect gymz, the nomin. sg.
femin. of a strong adj. belonging to the sterns in ia. Unlike
gymnas, gymtls·‚ this gym or gymi does not contain a diminutive
suffix. As to tua (al. tui) in compounds, cf. O. N. tvanflzldr,
twosold, A. S. twaniht, binoctium ς mascealu, bilanx; a. Ettm.
Lex. p. 552.

9 36. The Latin ⁴⁴ b0s‚” in 9 3 of cod. 1, &c., distinctly signifioe an
ox, as is evident from the Malb. obosino (read ochsino) in 2, ohsenoin
10, ocxino in 6. The form in which this well-known word here appears
is very awkward. It looks like a genit. or dat. case' sing. of ohso
(Frank. Psalm 65, 15), Goth. auhsa, Ο. Η. G. ohso, A. S. oxa, etc.
If it be a genit. (Goth. auh-rins), it must have been governed by some
substantive expressive os thert in the original text. Should it be a
dat. (Goth. aubin), then we must assume that the governing verb
expressive of stealing was construed with the dative, just as in Ο. N.
stela (s, Oxf. Dict. i. v.). The final ο 1 see no chance os explaining
otherwise than as an ⁴⁴ irrational ’³ vowel, analogous to the Goth. a
which follows the ending in n of the 3rd pers, plur. of the conj.
mood.

5 37. As highly taxed as an ox is a ⁴ ⁴ taurus bimus” sor which 6 and
10 have the special term rma-ile, tmslo, which Grimm (Pref. XXI)
proposes to identify with Ο. Ν. drasill, drb'sull, a horse, stom
drasla, succursorie ferri. It must be observed that an Ο. N. dr
does not regularly answer to a Frank. tr—or, maybe, thr, for th is
very osten carelessly expressed by a single t in our MSS.—but such
an anomaly is not uncommon: e. g. inO. S. drusinon, variant trus-non
