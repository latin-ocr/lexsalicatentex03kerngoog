NOTES. TITT. XXXV. XXXVII.

though the translators of the Lex deemed otherwise. The original
statement of the Frank. law must have been such that the juxtapo-
sition of theoleode aud theodeelim’a, al. theodulim‘a is explicable,
wh'ich is not the case in the Latin edition. The article of the
Frank. law probably ran somewhat like Ine's L. 74 τ “ Gis peow-
wealh Engliscne monnau ofslihss, ponne sceal sepe hine ah weorpan
hine te honda hlaforde οὔδε 60 scill. gesellan wib his feore. Gis
he ponne pone ceap nelle fore gesellan‚ bonne mdt hine se hlAford
gefreogan3 gielden 5188311 his maegas pone wer, gif he maegburg
haebbe fre0. Gif he nebbe, heden his pa gesanst’ The difference
in the social condition of the slain can hardly have affected the
obligations of the culprit’s owner save in so far as the amount of
the weregild is concerned3 cf. our Lex itse1f‚ § 5 of this Title.

ξ 182. For leotos musdo iu 1 read letas mur-do. The genit. letos
(letus in 7—9) of Ictu, leto is noteworthy, as it differs from the Ο. S.
form of mascul. stems in u, which is o or ies. The Malb. seems to
be misplaced, and to belong to ᾗ 4, though the manner in which 6
and 1o use theo where the text has ‘⁴ litus ” would suggest that letu
3ηά theo were sometimes applied promiscuously. This would not
be so very strange3 traces of such a carelessness—if we must call
it so—are visible‚ e. g. in the use of serf in English. Besides theo
and Ictu a third term occur-S, viz. rinc, rene, Ο. S. and A. S. rinc,
iuvenis-³, minister, of which the genit. rincus, rennes followed by
murdo, etc„ occurs in the Malb. of 2 and 7—-9, where the corrected
reading requires: rem-us murd0,· rincus monii. As for the e in-
stead of i it is not rare in dial. Dutch before ng, nk, e. g. M. D.
West-Flemish drenken for drinken and much more frequently in
the Limburg M. D.

Temos-ide, momust'do in ὁ should be theo-mardic, -murdio ,-
in 10 we must read theumordo, -mordt’0. Leciim mus-do is a cor-
ruption of letamur-do, be it a compound like theumurdio, or leto a
genit. c. analogous to Ο. S. suno. Distinctly a gen. sg. is ἰαττα- in
letus modi (read mordi) in 7—9. ’Πιε error in 2 must have arisen
from leto being spelt letum by a copyist who wrote under dictation‚
while letum became afterwards leciim (cf. above, ᾇ 2).

ἕ 183. Of claudinan'o in 6, and daudinan'oe in 10, either one is
corrupt—for it is evident that both cannot be correct at the same
time—or both are altered. The restoration is doubtful. Chandi-
naria (in the main = D. kandnering) would be ‘⁸ livelihood by the
hand ”3 naria = Ο. H. G. nara or neri, sustentatio, stipendium.
Chandinanb, being taken as a dative, might be rendered: ‘⁴ for
the livelihood ’⁹ ; and as the fine stated in 7—9 is higher than in 6,
10 and Lex Emend„ the purport of the Malb. was, perhapS, to in-
timate that, in addition to the fine of 1⁴} sol„ the offender had to
pay a certain sum in order to make up for the loss sustained by
the owner of the slave who had been disabled from working dur-
ing 40 days; or it points, perhapS, to a custom, which probably
existed, of a certain charge being made for the maintenance of such

a ssffggtmkes of the letters would also allow us to read chandmario,

i. e. -marrio, or in two words ckand mario (maria). The latter
would mean: “(is) he lays lame the hand,” or “mars the hand,
the working by the hand ”3 the former ‘⁴ the laying lame, marring
of the hand'’; mar-rum, Ο. Η. G. mam'an, Ο. Fris. mer-ian, im-
pedire, tricare, O.S. merrr'an, Frank. of the Gl. L. merran, D.
marren, mmm, meren, tardare, etc. (s. Kil. i. v.): cf. A. S.
myrran in the phrase “ pa he paes eorles earm amyrde ”, Byrhtn.
165. ·

1 would prefer adopting chandmario because we find so to say
the echo of itin the Latin “tricare opera sua,” and also because

515

daus in 7, dalius in 9 represents, if Ι 3111 not mistakeu, chaus,
Ο. Η. G. hans, Goth. hamss, κυλλός, another form of which, viz„
hds, we have already met with in derivatives. The proof that hans
may be applied to the laming of the hand is afforded by Ο. S.
gihdvt'd (in Gl. Prud. 592) being a rendering of ‘⁴ arens (dextera).”
Save the difference of adjective and substantive, chaus and chand-
maria convey the same meaning.
For teqfn'omosido, etc„ read theohreomordio.

XXXVII.

§ 184. Adckramire, etc„ in the first section of this title, points to
Frank. at-, ant-, an-chramz'an, which were not unlikely alternat·
ing forms, We know chramian already from Tit. XX in the sense
of ‘⁶ pinching, sq'ueezing, clutching,” Ο. N. Iar-emma. Almost the
same verb as hramian, and only differing stom it in conjugational
suffix is D. rumen (i. e. brumen), to tax, estimate3 to hit; to plan.
Another D. word aanslaan combines various shades of meaning of
hrumian and hramen (ai or o class), viz. to seize, take possession
of, confiscate; to hit ; to tax; to assess; the subst. aanslag more-
over significes an attempt, desig-n, plot3 the same applies to Germ.
anschlagen and anschlag. Wholly aualogous is the term for
adchramire in A. S. ιεζῐόη, hesdra, aetbesdn, aetfeng (cf. Schmid,
Ges. d. Angels„ p. 526), and M. G. anevaken, anevanc ; the M. D.
aanvangen also denotes “to seize ” (see v. Hasselt on Kil. i. v.).
It is clear that the different Latin renderings of σέβη, oetseng‚
anevanc are defective and too limited3 but “intertiatio '² is the
worst of them all, because this part of ⁴the transaction is only re-
quired in a peculiar case ’as stated iu our Lex. It waS, no doubt,
the difficulty of finding a Latin word equivalent to one of · such
various meanings as (at-, ant-‚ am) chramian' which induced the
translators to retain it. In the languages nearest allied to the
ancient Frankish dialects an adequate translation of adchramire is
afforded by the word already mentioned, namely D. aanslaan, G.
anschlagen. For another use of adchramire cf. Tit. XLVII.

The g in agramz're is due to the similar-Ity of the sounds ofch and
g, as pronounced in all Low-Frankish and Westphalian dialects.

ς 185. Solem collocare (in the third section) with its corrupted forms
collecare, cotegna, calcare, etc„ is inTit. CVI (LXXVI of cod. 10)
called sol[e}5atire‚ a would-be Latin word, whence with certainty
may be deduced a Frank. sblesatian, sdlsattian. As usual, the com-
pilers of the Latin text, instead of nmslating, i.e. rendering a certain
notion by its equivalent in another tongue, have been etymologiz-
ing. Sal, Ο. N. sal, A. S. sol, Goth. sauil, etc„ means the sun,
and salian, to place3 why should not they make “ solem collo·
care ’⁹ out of it? ‘nae answer is because such an idea is nonsensical
and because solratz'an is no compound at all, but a denominative
verb formed from a compound, namely socrati, which must have
denoted “ a natural day ”3 cf. Ο. Ν. sdlsetr, in me& scih-etrum, all
day long3 milli deretra, from sunrise till sunset (s, Oxf. Dict. i. v.).
We find quite an accurate rendering of solsatire in French ajour-
ner ,· in Dutch and German analogously dagen, tugen, to summon,
and ver-dogm, ver-tugen, to adjourn. The French word, like solra-
τίνα, combines the double meaning of summoning and adjourn-
mg.

ἕ 186. The gloss mithio franito (fr-asitha, frassitho) in 7-9,
mitho strastatido in 6, mim'mbsmstatitio‚ frastatlzinto in 10 recurs
afterwards as the rubric of Tit. LXVI. Frasitto, frasittho is the
genit. or dat. c. of frasittha, fiasitta, a contraction of smsz'titha
(cf. Ο. Η. G. gasisida aud the like). The corresponding verb is
