NOTES. TITT. LIV. LV.

living too near the Middle Ages to care much about it, a “ secret ”
tribunal. That heimelijk gm‘cltt, i. e. the veem, is the heimgm'cht
needs no proof (cf. Grimm, R. A. 829); it is the Ο. Ν. heimi-
lzlrkvi‘br, the verdict‘ given by the Intimilii-Mar ,· and also the
college giving the verdict (¹); cf. heimrkkvibr, heinukvissr, in Oxf.
Dict. i. v. kviiir. What is called keimili in 0. N. is termed mallo-
berg-ium (of uncertain gender) in the Lex Salica, or mallum.
Mallobergi, stem -bergia, is an adjective, a regular derivative from
malloberg,· isit beused as a substantive, in the neuter gender, it
denotes “ whatever belongs to a malberg, a sorum,'' i. e. a parish,
commune; in dial. Dutch maachItap, commune, commonaIty, and
collectively those who meet at the same malepol, i. e. male-hill ,·
precisely as Lex Emend. puts it: ‘⁸ plebs (i. e. the commons)
quae ad unum manum convenire solent.’' In its formation mallo-
bergi may be compared with Ο. Ν. Ιιεύηἰίἱ. Adal is a more com-
prehensive term including malberg and maffiergi.

To sum up: the mallobergi'as sacibaron, al. sagr'baron, are veridici,
a jury, akin to the heimilzk-bdar of the Norse law, and to the
scabini (vriscepenen, fletis-cbb‘ffen) of the Veem. In so far as saci,

succe, sace means “ crimen, guilt,'’ and “ prosecution‚” the term ’

sacibaro agrees with veemnoot ; cf. Ο. S. asehian, to doom. No
less suitable is the name οἰεαὲῠσνω, because to them belongs the
kvissburlir.

LV.

ᾗ 24 5. For muster-in 2 read munker, A. S. morber, murder. In
10 we have to read chreomordio or perhaps -morido, a possible careless
pronunciation of mordo, like wen‘dario for merdario (Tit. XXXIX).
In 6 there is required either breomordzb or hreomorido ,· in 7-9
ebreornurdo. Uuaden‘do in 1 is a misread murder-ido, apparently
the dative of mur-denua or murder-tilia. Such words stand to the
partic. pret. pass· (which in the present case is murden'd) almost in
the same relation as in Lat. dabis-nb stands to debeis-ur, aestimata: to
aestimatus, etc. cf. mordn‘da, murdrido in Lex Baiovar. 18, 2.
The Latinized murder-:rum in Lex Fris. 20: ‘⁴ si quis hominem
occiderit et absconderit, quod mur-dmum vocant ” points to a
neuter murdrith, unless it be formed from the partic. mur-derit
(murder-id). As to the proper meaning of murda cf. Notes to Tit.

Ἢὸ. Ὶὶινηι· chelis, thumi chale in 10, to which add thumi

chale in Tit. XIV, is a misread thur-uz· chalir, -ι-Ιιαῖε, -chalt, The
correct reading in 2 (Tit. XIV) is thama· chale ,· in 7-9 thur-vi
chal ,· in 6 thor-ue chale-r, -cltala Har-vi, thurve, thome is A. S.
pur-fe, Ο. H. G. thurfi, etc., egeat, from tharjf, eget. Chalzlr,
chates is decidedly the genit. case of a masc. or neuter substantive 3
chalt is as decidedly an accusative3 chale may be a genitive, pro·
vided the word be a feminine, but it seems preferable to take it for
an accusative, whatever may be the gender. We leam from the
various readings that thaman in Frankish like pur-sa in Ο. N. is
construed sometimes with the genitive, at other times with the
accusative.

Chaa, chale is Ο. Η. G. hal, tegmen, with the exception, per-
haps, of the gender (s. Graff, Spr. IV, 844). Chazt (for chald) is
Ο. Η. G. helid, “tugurium,'' properly “tectum ”3 Ο. Ν. hald,
entertainment‚ support. stur-02¹ chalir, etc., “ egeat tecte, hospi·
tio ’' is, so to say, a paraphrase of margus sit, let him be anoutlaw.

(²) The Oxf. niet. should not have failed to remark that ὲυιῖςν is both the
verdict and, collectively, those who give the ven-dict. More accurate is the
Index to the Gragaa, i. v. qm'fir, veridici ς effatum veridicorum.

Cod. 6 has, as so osten elsewhere, preserved a fuller form of the
imprecation (Tit. XIV): thome challac sive odo carina. Intended
is thor-ve cluullas (or chaldir) odo thacina,· as odo. Ο. Η. G. odo,
A. S. οὔδε means “or,” it follows that the Latin “sive'' is
superfluous, Tkacina is the genit. of thacina, Ο. S. thecina, tectum
(Gl. Arg. 167), A. S. pec-en, tegmen, tectum. The association of
helan and thact’an is so natural that it is not surprising to find them·
in each other's company3 thus in Ο. H. G. helia luzil si theckenne ;
helitin, thale, tegumen (cf. Graii, 1. c.). It is always difficult to
give an adequate translation of such pregnant phrases, but we shall
not be far wrong, I trust, if we render thor-ve challisodo thacina by:
‘⁴ egeat hospitio et tect0.’' Odo, or, is here used, because thur-van
is a negative idea. cf. Gragas 2, 100: “tel ek No, eiga at verb'a
sekian sk6garmann oaelan, dfeq'anda‚ 6rai5andi 511 bjargrab ’ 3 aad
134, ibid.

ᾗ 247. Stappl, a stake, column, is the common Teutonic word,
A. S. mpul, stipes, columna; Ο. Fris. stapel, a pale, stake; Ο. N.
stbpull, a column ; Ο. Η. G. stapha! and scaphula, alternating with
stofftd and staffala ,· cf. the Latinized stafflus in ἦ 4 (note) of 10.

Stapplus serves to explain anis-tatonem in Lex Emend., whence it
follows that the term wanting this explanation had become obso-
lete. On comparing the various readings we must provisionally
adopt as the intended reading in 10 ckenlrtaduna, and kanktatlaeone
in Lex Em.

Staduna, stathone is the accus. of a weak subst. masc. or fem.
stada, statho—if fem. probably smda, statha. The final a and e
are to be explained in the same manner as in the case of ohseno
(cf. Tit. 111); the Ο. S. form would be stabam, stoma. Statlw,
stada and stappl are synonymouS‚ and in so far the interpretation in
10 and Lex Emend. is unimpeachable3 cf. A. S. stati, a post;
mebstudu, columna, fulcrum (Ο. Η. G. stafal, basis) ; Ο. N.
stavia, a stud, column; A. S. staool, basis3 O. Fris. dikstathul
has its equivalent in the Middle Sax. text dijkstapel (Fris. LL. 122).

The great difficulty of the word lies in cheri, al. kari, hare,
supposing that the form without initial k be incorrect, which is far
from certain, because the Lex Emend. is notin the habit of neglect-
ing the Ιι.

Chenlrtom'ca i'n 6 is a very doubtful reading. Stum'ca might be
a diminutive form of some lost word staua, Skr. ετΙιάζιὰ, a column,
but the corresponding terms in the other codd. rather induce me
to suppose that the word intended is stocina, a derivative analogous
to E. stockade from stoc, A. S. stocc, O. H. G. stoc, stoch, etc.

As to (an')··staconein B (Tit. XIV, col. os 7·9), this seems to
be right3 A. S. staca, a stake, post: Ο. Fris. sta'kc ; Ο. H. G.
εἰει-61η), a stake3 collectively: the enclosure. We may even go
further and suspect that (Inaristato, if not everywhere, at least in
?-9 is a misread (mad-staca, the more so because by reading cleeri-
stiacona for cher-istrkzdona we can explain the i, which recurs in
Ο. Ν. εζίαὲί, a stake.

ἦ 248. Madoaue, mandoudo, Latinized nundum, contains mlle,
walo, wale, which is akin to the common Teutonic παίζει, A. S.
weall, D. wal, Ο. Ν. vb'llr, etc., and alternates with A. S. wala
in wyrtwala, ·walu (Ettm. Lex. 99) = wyrttruma ,· also in Latin
vallus and vallum, Skr. walaya, cahrawdla, circumference, com-
pass; also in adjectives as O. Η. G. sinawell, sinuwell, uhwdl,
all round; Ο. Ν. sivalr, etc. In some cases wal appears to have
the function of a mere suffix, and to be interchangeable with the
suffix ala. How wal- and al- are in every respect connected need
not be discussed in this place; suffice it to recall the fact that
A. S. wyri-evah means exactly the same as O. H. G. marsala,
