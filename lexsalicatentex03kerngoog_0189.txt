hesitate between chlunni and dilium, chliume, the former =A. S.
hlyn, talin, sound; the latter = Goth. hliuma, the hearing, ear.
Since Ο. S. Idu-rt most distinctly signifies not only the ear in

Heliand 148, 24, but clearly also the listening, attention, 119, 19, ι

there is not a single reason why Munna· should be limited to the
one meaning it has in A. S.; 01. Skr. fravas, ear; soundg fame.
Our MSS. strongly point to the latter alternative, and Ι would,
therefore, prefer chlunm'- (chlunne) cleosa (cleufa). The corrupted
eliano in 6, chdna 10 10, yield after correction chlunno, chlunnu ,·
in other words, the original stem os the word was Munjus, formed
like its synonym Goth. dmnjus, a noise, D. dreun.

ᾗ 168. For alchacio in 7 read althagio or althaclu'o ,⁶ for kala-
cluzcio in 9 alathagio without the cockney h ; alcheri> in 8 stands
101· althe(h)io. This Malb„ be it one word and a substantive or
adjective, or two words and one 01 them a verb, contains at any
rate al, ala, all. magio, thachio, theio, may be a regular 3rd
pers. sing. proe. subj. 01 thagoian, thagz‘an, etc., a verb 01 the ai
claSS, Goth. palum, O. S. thagx‘an, Ο. Ν. pegia, O.H. G. dagln,
tacere. On the other hand it must be admitted that altbagn'a,
genit. or dat. ·g·i0, may as well be a substantive, materially the
same as 0. N. pb'gn, silence. We may go further and affirm that 11
ala in 8 be correct—and there is no sufficient reason to doubt it—
the compound, and consequently no verbal form, is intended, as ala
is exclusively used in composition, differently from the adverbs
with double l. A similar passage in the Fris, LL. 87, 1: “Jes
thet age is elle blind, hundred skillinga ’', decides nothing; yet it
shows that the use 01 110 adjective, be it a compound or otherwise,
would be admissible. Ι do not think, however, that such an adjec-
tive, let us say althagul, is concealed in alchaltua 01 10. Alchal-
tua (read alchaltia) in 10, and achaltea (read alchaltea) in 6, are
substantives derived from an adjective alchalt, i. e. wholly halting
(in speech) 3 cf. A. S. healt, Ο. H. G. hala, halt. That kalt is
also applied to a defect in speech appears from O. N. haltr at mdlx·
and mdllzaltr3 s. Oxf. Dict. i. v. haar.

ξ 169. Laclabina in § 17 016, etc., is an erroneous repetition 01
1110 Malb. in ξ 13 01 1110 same cod„ and as 1110 make up sor the
omission 01 1110 required initial there, the cod. puts a wrong ἰ where
it is not wanted. It is difficult to see what the original term 101
“ dentem excusserit ” ean have been, obscured as it is by scribes
who everywhere and at all times are apt to overlook minor differ·
ences between words they do not understand. There must have

been a certain similarity between the terms denoting ‘⁸ excussio ·

oculi ’⁹ and ‘⁴ excussio dentis ;” otherwise the temptation 01 repeat-
ing what preceded would 001 have overpowered the copyists 01 at
least two 01 1110 principal codiceS. It is easy to guess tant- or tusc-
habim (bovina), but it remains a mere guess.

ξ 170. Gasferit in 2 is another example 01 scribes having a predi·
lection sor uniformity. We have seen in Tit. XVII what gusfrit

means; it can never have expressed castration‚ though serit cer· ·

tainly is a vicarious form 01 frit (1. 0. srith), hurt, scathing. That
ferit is really right is proved by dardi 01 1110 011101 Μ58., 101· we
know from Tit. XXIV that the two words are synonymouS.
There can, consequently, be no question 01 identifying ferit with
A. S. syran, O. H. G. fiurian, sciren, apart 11010 1110 difficulty of
reconciling the e in fm't with the iu or its Umlaut. By a slight
change we get the word we want, namely, ganfferit, ‘⁸ the hurtiug
01 the virga ”, as gard is the common Teutonic word to express this
idea. The decis-ive proof that the Franks used the same word is

507

afforded by the Malb. αισι-11119110 (ιι garde) in ξ 1801 1ο, i. e. 1110
whole virga, or, as the text puts it: ‘⁶ (virgulam) ad integrum '’; 101·
tharae in the corresponding ἦ 01 6 read charde. cf. A. S. geard,
Ο. H. G. gurda, garde (ι), gardea, D. garde, E. yard. Ala, accord-
ing to the interpretation 01 1110 translators, seems to be an adverb ;
hence their “ad integrum.’' One would rather expect alla,
integram, or even, 11 an adverb, alla = Ο. Fris. elle, omnino,
wholly.

Dardi, darde, needs no further comment. Uuz'rv, umba, and
mutilated uui must be synonymous with garde. Although the
word does not occur, as far as 1 know, in the sense 01 “ virga‚” yet
1 consider it to be genuine, and not differing etymologically 110111
m‘rd, A. S. wir, Skr. wezzi, etc. (01. Notes on Tit. XXIV). Not
to speak of A. S. wir or wir, which the dictionaries explain as
“ ramus '' (01. wimeo, myrtus, Ettm. Lex. 91), 1 would point out
that Skr. wezzi is manifestly connected with wegru, a rod, reed,
bamboo, flute, and at the same time with wetasa, a reed, ratan,
Lat. vr'tzk, etc. Now waitasa, another form 01 wetasa, is used in
ngeda 10, 95, 5 in the sense which garde, charde has in the

XXX.

ξ 171. Quin is in all probability the D. kween, Geldrian kwm,
a barren cow ς a hermaphrodite ; in M. D. kwene (quem) is more-
0ver used in the sense 01 1110 corresponding E. quean (01. Κ11. 1. v.).
7710 10 9, i. 0. 11100, may be explained by reference to the construc-
tion with the accusative in exclamations, such as me mis-emm ! and
the like; the accusative is usual in D. 0150, 0. g. jou schelm ! In
Skr. the accus. is the most common construction after ahik, fie!
shame! dhik traam, shame 00 thee! Ι1 11115 explanation be right,
thac in 6 can only be an error 101· thae = the, or thoec = thee, A. S.
pec, te, whereas tuo (10 10) may have been intended sor tat, i. 0. θεά,
thou, which, when an enclitic, usually loses the aspirate. The only
difficulty is the place 01 1110 pronoun after quin, 101 which 1 am not
able to adduce a sure example. ·

ξ 172. Extrabo in 10 is a quasi French form 01 strabo, which
ought to be scrabo. Another manner 01 Frenchifying is seen in
decr-abo 01 7 10 ᾖ 2, which has given rise to the cockney Ιι 10 ln·-
schmbo in 9. Ser-abo, sehr-abo is certainly allied to Ο. Ν. skroefa,
a coward, and, with the exception 01 1110 gender, perhaps identical
with it, as the Ο. N. word is a grammatical, though not a logical,
femin. and scr-abo can hardly be otherwise than a weak mascul„
about which more hereaster. Besides O. N. skroesa, there are
many other words 01 abuse which stand in more or less close re·
lationship, having this in common with the Frank. terms in the
Malb„ that their signification is very indistinct, except so far as
they are decidedly terms 01 abuse. Nearest to scrabo and skraefa
stand Ο. N. skmffinnr, skrafinnr, a chatterer ς skrasari, a 01011-
name3 M. D. schrobber, homo vilis ς 10 N. D. a scoundre13 M. D.
schmeffeler, cerd0, lucrio, In austrupo 01 10 we may safely regard
strupo as a misread serape, whatever. au may be. This form with
p has its counterpart in O. N. skrapr, a tattler. Somehow there
must be a connexion between all these forms and those 01 1110
verbs to scrupe, to smbble, to scmffle, D. schrapem schrabben,
M. D. schmven. Allied are D. krabben, Ο. N. kmbba, mssa, to
scratch. Therefore Ι think that scmpo and scr-abo were used also
