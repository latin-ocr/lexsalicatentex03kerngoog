NOTES. PRELIMINARY REMARKS.

Wherever a gloss has become corrupt owing to the peculim-ities
of the semi-Latin pronunciation‚ we may be satisfied that such a
gloss was written under dictation. But it is certain that other
errors have crept in because the scribes mistook the written
characters, It is impossible, even approximately, to guess the
relative date of the birth of each particular error, since the codices
belong to widely different familieS, with such restrictions as will
be pointed out presently.

ξ 3. If, in order to determine the genealogical relation of the
MSS„ we allow ourselves to be guided by the glosseS, we shall,
unless Ι greatly err, arr-ive at the following resultS. Codd. 7, 8
and 9 are intimately connected, and derived from a not very
distant common source, so that their combined testimony, where
it is opposed to that of otherS, only counts for one. Viewed
separately, they appear to stand at an equal distance from their
source, but not so from each other. That is to say, from a
common parent—let us call it A--have sprung a and b; 7 and 9
are the issue of a, 8 of b. Consequently 7 and 9 may be termed
brotherS, 8 is their cousin.

The connexion between codices 6 and 10, though distant and some·
what veiled, is unmistakeable. The glosses in the latter- MS„
now lost, show throughout the traces of an ably revising and
renovating hand. The person who was able to replace chambclzeetto
by cherecheto (111. 7), changirto by chengzlrto (XLI. 2), and the
like, was perfectly acquainted with the language. The unknown
reviser cannot have been the same person as the scribe, sor there
are a few blunders in 10 which prove beyond doubt that the copyist
was quite ignorant of Frankish, the numerals tw0, three, five, &c.,
being mysteries to him. Taken as a whole, cod. 10 is the best
manuscript, or rather the only tolerably good one, a fact the more
explicable when we consider that the revised readings had not yet
had time to become so utterly corrupt as the older ones in the other
MSS„ which had remained without the benefit of a revision by
competent hands. Hence the glosses in 6, though much more
ancient in their phonetical aspect and in a few caseS, perhapS,
essentially more original too, are far more deteriorated than those
111 10.

Cod. 2 belongs to a third family. Its glosses look nowhere younger,
but in a few cases older, than those in 6. When 2 has a gloss
materially different from the corresponding one in the other codiceS,
it becomes difficult to decide which of the two is more original,
because the different termS, considered as mere wordS, must have
existed side by side in the language. The clerical eri-ors 111 2 are
numerous; its scribe was evidently a stranger to Frankish.

The glosses in cod. 1 look as ancient as those in 2. Some
coincidences in the choice of the terms might at first sight
suggest the idea of a special connexion between the two, but 011
closer inspection we perceive that the coincidences between 2 and 6,
10 or 7, 8, 9 are more numerouS, ahd certainly more close than
between 2 and 1. The stray coincidences between 1 and 2 may be
explained by assuming that cod. 1 or its parent is an eclectical
work based upon various ancient MSS. At any rate, cod. 1, as a
whole, stands far away srom 2 as well as from 6, 7, 8 and 9. It
differs in one important point from all the other codiceS, 4 excepted,
in that it consistently writes thunginus‚ whereas the others have as
consistently tunginus.

A determination of the relative place of codd. 3, 4, and 5 is of
no practical interest, as far as the glosses are concerned3 for our
purpose they are all but worthleSS.

Ι do not think it necessary to trace the genealogy of the MSS. any

further. The chain of evidence is broken, and only a few links have
been preserved which we may violently weld together, but cannot
make to fit.

It must not be supposed that, in basing my estimation of the
relationship os the codices upon the glosseS, Ι pretend to decide
anything as to the jurist’s view of the question. This is wholly out
of my sphere. Still, Ι think it right to observe that the results Ι
have come to, nearly coincide with those arrived at by Merkel,
independently and in another way.

§ 4. A disquisition on the probable origin of the material varia-
tions in the glosses must ultimately lead to the question, whether
the Latin text be an original composition or a more or less free
translation. Grimm, in the passage already quoted, expresses the
opinion that the Lex Salica sprung into existence in the 5th century.
He considers it to have been composed hythe Franks in Latin,
though in doing so they could not avoid using many indigenous
words which were Latinized for the purpose (¹). At the same
time he fully admits (²) that “the words and formulae, as re·
mainders of the indigenous forensic language (gemebas-pruche), by
no means look as if they were translations from the Latin, but
rather as original.''

In fact, the profound scholar nowhere intimates a doubt as to the
previous existence of Frank laws. On the contrary, he speaks of a
“ forensic language,” which presupposes a comparatively developed
practice of the law. All the materials for the compilation of the
Latin Lex Salica being extant, its originality can only be an
originality of the second order; the Latin text may be original in
its arrangement, but it is not 50 111 its constituent parts, It is
possible, not to say probable, that every phrase of it existed already
in a Frankish form. Even if the whole of the first part, dating from
a period before Chlovis, has not been bodily translated, its originality
is a qualified one. Supposing the first Frank compilers to have
written 'down the result of their legislative labours in Latin, even
then the Latin text is but quasi-original, because those men cer-
tainly did not discuss and think 111 a foreign language. F'or those
who wish to explain the Frank termS, either in the glosses or in the
text, such a kind of originality is 111 reality nothing else but a trans-
lation from an original which was never written down, but never·
theless actually existed in the mind of the author.

If we have to believe the statements of the Prologues, grave
doubts arise even in regard to the qualified originality of the Latin
text. We are told that the greater and oldest part of the law was
framed or compiled by a committee of four men elected from th‘ree
villages situated, according to one of the Prologues, beyond the
Rhine—of course the Lower Rhine. Due allowance being made for
the legendary character of such statementS, we may, I imagine, fairly
infer from the Prologues that, in the tradition of the FrankS, their
Salic Law dated from a period considerably anterior to the gth
century, and ·had remained essentially the same, notwithstanding
such modifications and additions as became necessary in the course
os time. This much seems to be well ascertained and generally
admitted that the first part of the Law is anterior to the reign of
Chlovis. What could have induced the heathen Franks of those
