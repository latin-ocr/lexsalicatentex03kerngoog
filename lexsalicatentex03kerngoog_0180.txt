ᾗ 123. Rosidio in 6 is certainly wrong. By reading rost-idio,
the riding a horse, we get a plausible explanation. Ros for leros
is not strange, considering that the form with h has well nigh
wholly disappeared in O. H. 6., 23 may be seen in Graff, Spr. IV.
1 179, sq. Ridio is an oblique case, not unlikely the instrumental,
os ridi, D. rid, G. νέα, 2 ride. For all practical purposes the
same term (mr-essm& and (h)rossa rein, is the usual one in Ο. Ν.,
decidedly in the sense os unlawsul (²) horse-riding; s. 6123. Ῑ, 432 3

headed Os rossa-ret'ssir shows a great family likeness to the Salic
Law. It runs thus: “ Es mat5r hleyprd bak hrossi mans 6losat,
pat vardar v1 aura dfang. Nu rib‘r hann fram or sta& ok varvar
pat 111 marka (arlegtsss’ This reads almost like the Latin text of
6 and 10: ‘⁶ si quis caballum alienum extra consilium domini sui
The difference between the
Norse law and the Lex salica is that in the latter the mounting and
riding on are considered as constituting one act; on the other hand
the Lex resolves, so to speak‚ the 201 11110 1110 two stages of mount·
ing and slighting; the whole fine, which amounts to 30 sol., is 2130
divided into two halves, each os them os 15 sol. In 7-9 indeed the
division is not made, or is we would distinguish two parts or stages
os the offence they would be the mountii‘ig. and riding on. It
would seem, however, that the text in 7-9 has been tampered with,
sor leodardi, i. e. 2 technical term for a fine of 15 sol., does not
harmonize with the tenor os the text, which probably originally had
the same as 10.

An analogon to the theoretical reduction os 2 whole act into two
parts is the distinction between the entering and going out of some
wounding object, as found in the F risian Laws. Instead of stating
the rull amount os a fine sor a complete wound, hals the sum is
fixed sor the going in, ingong, inkeme, and the other half for the

that char-scaro, which is wanting in the older texts», is an innovation
of the revisers, 2 substitute for an older reading the meaning of
which they sailed to understand. In the original text the term may
have been chdrechano, Μαι-110110, crinitum, the 200113. sing. masc.
os the adJect. chdrech, Mreg, etc„ hairy. Such 2 word might be
easily understood, it would seem. In reality, however, the reverse
is the 0230, because ‘⁴ hairy ” may be used in two senses, and one οἱ
1110111, in 2 certain point of view, exactly the reverse of the other.
The wearing os long hair was in general 2 token of nobility or of
high caste; in 3ο far 2 “ puer crinitus ” may mean a noble or fiee-
bom boy. But if hair was taken in the conventional sense of
hairtui't on the head, a ‘⁸ hairy boy ” would be one who had not yet
his hairhanging down; in such a case a hairy boymay be said to
be the opposite of “puer crinitus ”<²). Now, it is cun‘ous to note
how even the more ancient texts first speak os 2 0ογ below twelve
years of age and afterwards of 2 “ puer crinitus,” whereas 7-10 add
“ non tonsuratus,” further amplified into ‘⁴ sive crinitum sive incri-

(²) Another meaning of scam shows Ο. Ν. skb'r, Ο. H. G. scam, i. e. tun ot'
hair, the hair of the head.

(⁸) 1t entirely depends upon the custom of the various tribes or families in
which sense the same word ‘⁶ hair⁹⁹ is to be taken.
