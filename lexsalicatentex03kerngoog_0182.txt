NOTES.

rash to assume that by ann os the Malb. niw has been effaced or
superseded. Annona in 7, anno ano in 9, anno uano in 8, look as
is they were written by one who saw traces of some letter between
o and a, without being able to make out what character it was. In
short, the original may have had something like the following:
bam ancando (variant anteando) and niuu- (κτλ, nuw) &dano
(oudam). Niu, etc„ requires no justification3 cf. Goth. niuklahs,

new-born, νήπιος. ὂᾱαηο, Ο. S. Adana, Mane, oudano, is the
weak neuter accus, sing. os o‘dan, O. S. ddan, born, a word
familiar to all readers of the Heliand.

ᾗ 128. In the second § of 6 we meet with a repetition of the error
chascaro, read chdrscaro, hair-shearing‚ corresponding to “ si quis
puerum totonderit.” The cutting off the hair of a girl is called
thevecata, read tkeoascatha. Theoi, representing the-m, Goth.
piwi, etc., a girl, shows a spelling not common in the Malb., but
frequent enough in Frank. documentS, e. g. Ebroin for Ebrwin,
and the like. This way os writing points to a pronunciation of the
w, like that os the English, among some Franks (¹). Scatha, if it
be a variety of scama—which is possible—would be exactly Ο. Fris.
scatha, scada, O.H. G. scado, injury: allied to Goth. skapz's. 1t
may also be a femin. word, D. schade. However that may be, it is
at any rate derived from a verb, A. S. scoetffian, scaiman, ειγδόαη,
laedere, vulnerare, O. N. ska& ja, to scathe, burt. A legitimate
variation in spelling is sckada in «musa-bada os 2. Tha is another
pronunciation for thiu ,· it also occurs in the plural thum in Gl. L.
9363 cf. D. wouw for m‘u, houwelzjk for huweujk from Ιιίτυί, etc.
For theochada in 7 read theoschada ,· sor theohichada in 9, theon·-
schada. In order to show how closely the idiom of the Franks
resembles in small details that of the FrisianS‚ their neighbourS,
it is worth while to remark that in the Frisian Law we observe 'the
‚same words scara and scathzjgia, scothia (haimon, *scathoz‘anj or
their derivatives as fully synonymous. Thus Ο. Fris. ἢθη-κά is used
in the same sense as hdrscara in the Malberg (s. Richth. GlosS.
i. v.). A common term for cutting, sharp, is O. Fris, scath,
scade ,· thus mith scadu wepne, scade wepne alternate with mitk
παφα we‘pen (cs. Richth. Gloss. i. v. skaal). Clear traces of the
same idiom occur in 0.N.; e. g. in Grag. 11, 11 we read: “En
pa er skorit, er skeddr beini e‘b‘r brjoski‚'’ which the editor trans-
lates by ‘⁴ secatum dicitur cum os vel cartilago laeditur.’'

In theoctidia (read theoscidz'a Ρ) in 10, scidz'a stands sor scedia,
in which e is the Umlaut of a. Since the i, taking the place
of the Umlaut of a, very frequently occurs in M. D. when followed
by n, it may be that we ought to read scindia = scendia, materially
the D'. schending, violati0n‚ spoiling; from schenden, A. S. scendan,
scyndan‚ contumelia afficere3 cf. Ettm. Lex. 672, sq. and Grein,
Gloss, i. v. scendan. Thercoheata in 10 shows unmistakeable
traces os a second-hand correction misunderstood by the scribe,
theos-chama, a vicar-ious form for thuschada in 2, will be right. That
the term must agree with the one used in 2 follows moreover from
the juxtaposition of uuerdarda in 10, evidently the gloss uirdade
in 2. Add to this uz'dn'darclzi of cod. 1 in Tit. LXIX. For
dorda we would rather expect dardi = dar-de (thus we must read in
2) and darthi (intended in 1). Darthi is anot uncommon Frankish
form sordardi, like fer-tbi of the Frank.Psalrns·forserdi. It is derived
from a lost deran, whence A. S. den'an, D. deren, to hurt, scathe,
in the same way as O. H. G. sear-ti, abscisio (in lidscam', s, Graff,

(²) Now-a-days such an English sound of w only survives in village: on the
seacoast οἱ South Holland. ·

TIT. XXIV.

Spr. VI, 528); or, perhaps we might say, from an adjective dat-tle,
dard, like scorti from scart, Ο. Ν. skart5 r, sheared, hacked, di-
minished; O. Fris. skerde. In fact, in meaning, dardi, and a
possible vicarious dar-da for dardia, do not differ from D. decr,
hurt, or A. S. derung (Ettm. Lex. 559), darn, O. H. G. tara,
tar-unga, Ο. Fris. dem, etc„ all synonymous with scatha, etc„
and akin in signification to scham. The former part of the com-
pound is uuerd, werd, wird, win‘d, Ο. H. G. wid, tortus, flexus ς
wirto, filix (¹), evidently meaning here a hair-plait, wreath,
W‘n'ddanhi, intended in 1 (Tit. LXIX), wirdarde, werd(d)arda
in 10 signil'y “ the scathing the hair-plait or wreath.”

It cannot be doubted that the strangely disfigured autchardo in
7, etc., contains, if not the same elements as werddardi, at least the
same idea. The same may be said of schuisara chrogino in ιο. In
schuisara we perceive that ms, being an after-correction, has pene-
trated into the body of the word scham. Schara being known, we
may be satisfied that char-do in 7-9 requires to be corrected into
sehardo, O. H. G. scarti, O. Fris. scherd, a shearing, which stands
to schardi in the same relation as e. g. A. S. hyldo to Ο. S. haldi,-
or leodardo to leodardi, and similar instanceS. Chrogino is a mis-
take sor chdrogino, i. e. ‘⁶ criniti,'’ the genit. masc. sing. os the weak

- declension of charog. That the Frank idiom keeps to Goth. and

Ο. H. G. with respect to the ending in of the genit. and dat. we
know from the Malb. oxino ,· in preponderates also in the Frank.
Psalms, e. g..hem'n (domini), 67, 21 ; 70, 163 herr-in (domino), 67,
3² ς 72, 28. Yet the ending on, analogous to A. S. an, Ο. S. on,
an, un, is not wholly wanting in the dialect of the Psalms and
the Gloss. L. (cf. Heyne‚ Laut-und Flextbnslehre, p. 277), nor
in the Salic Law; cf. Notes to Tit. CVI. As regards the additional
o, cf. the Notes on oxino in Tit. 111.

1t now remains to explain uas οἱ 10, aut os 7, huuc of 9, uus of 8.
This much is obviouS, that aut is a badly read unt, which some
cockney wrote lauat. Further, it will hardly be contested that κίε,
uut, uus, must be radically and virtually identical with wz'rd, a hair-
plait, wreath,· Were it not for a doubtful Ο. H. G. witta, filix,
mentioned by Grais, Spr. 1, 102 5, 1 would not hesitate to read
uuirt-sehardo in 7, 8, 93 as wit-d regularly becomes wir-t in a case
like this. At all events we cannot be far wrong in reading uuir-t.
Uis or uix-t would be admissible if the doubtful wasta proved to be
right (⁸). The Malb. allows us also to read uisa or uim. Wm
would be Ο. H. G. wira, rviam, a crown, diadem, erest (cf. Graff,
Spr. 1, 961), allied to A. S. wir, O. N. virr, wire3 wir would be
identical with the English word ; cf. Ο. N. vira-virki, filigree.
The corresponding Skr. word is wezzi, wezzi, a plait, wreath, wire,
thread; the lingual ῃ points to an older wesni or wer-ni ,· the
simpler form of the root is wi, wi (wayati), to which also belongs,
among others, Old Slavonic weni‘ci', a crown, wreath; cf. Tit.
XXIX, at the end.

ὁ 129. Satala, M. D. male, a damsel, a young lady, has been, so
to say, Frenchified into exmala in 103 cf. extn‘ngere for stringere,
Tit. XX. Another corruption of the same kind is mala, changed
by some cockney into hismala ; cf. ispican'um of cod. B, Tit. XVI,

(¹) Cs. Graff, Spr. 1, 1025.

(⁹) 1 suspect that in usudredo in δ 5 of 10(col. 61) some word like unas· (or
uut't‘) derdo ··-= medardi is hidden, and that the gloss is misplaced. In order to
explain such an error, 1 assume that the original text had charagma (i. e. cri-
m‘ls) wtsderdo ,· the translator took chdrvg in the sense of ckamg, a servant.
The confusion is the more easily explained because a. dialectic form chamg
may have existed by the side of charam cf. below l 133.
