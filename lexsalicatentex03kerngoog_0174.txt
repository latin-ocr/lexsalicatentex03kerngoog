NOTES. TIT. XVI.

salina’' in the latter ὅ, we perceive that the translator had before him a
word admitting of different rendering. Such aword is easily found,
viz„ hal, written al according to the cockney propensities os the
codex. Hm is properly a covered or root'ed place, a sense which
survives in N. H. G. trinkhalle, drinking booth; D. vleeschhal,
shambles; French halle ,· and appears also in A. S. heau, aula,
O. N. hb‘ll, O. S. halla, etc.; in.0. H. G., halla is rendered by
“ templum,” but also in the compound bathus by ‘⁶ salina ” (Graff,
Spr. IV, 859 and 850); hence M. H. G. halgrave, haktat (¹); for
the various shades os meaning os M. D. halle see Kil. i. v. The
obvious meaning os hal in halthifathio is that of A. S. heall, but
the translator, more cautiously than judiciously, preferred to enume-
rate the different significations in which hall was used, and has by
doing so given the clue to the restoration and explanation of the
term. 7713‘fathi0, better thefathio, is the nomen act. os a verb
theson, A. S. pefian, aestuare in animo (Ettm. Lex. 581), Skr. tap ,-
cf. Lat. tepz'dus, Slav. teplo, topiti, etc. stef alternates with des,
which appears in other codices (²), and is nearly allied to O. N.
Peyfja, to smell, as appears from comparing D. reuk, richen,
ruiken, Germ. geruch, riechen, with rook, rauch, E. reek. ste-
fathio, thzjfathzb, is derived from theson, like Goth. mitadjo, μέτρον,
from miton, and the numerous Latin words in tio, as crematim etc.
Halthefathzb consequently is the ‘⁴ burning of a (wooden) hall '' ς in
other words : ‘⁸ si quis casam quamlibet incenderit.''

ἕ 96. Selaneffsa in 2 should be sel-anetheffa or mnttheffa. Sel
either stands for sele, Ο. S. seli, A. S. sele, or it is bodily A. S. sel ,· in
either case it means the same thing, viz. ‘⁶ aula, aedeS, domu5.”
Anetheffa, apparently a strong femin. like Ο. S. sorga, sorrow, and
similar wordS, has as its verb anethefdn ,· antthefa would belong to
antthesbn. Both prefixes are appropriate3 cf. A. S. onaelan, incen-
dere, accendere, with D. ontsteken, but O. H. G. inzundjan ,· cf.
Grimm, D. G. ΙΙ, 808 sqq.

ὅ 97. The second Malb. in 2, leodi selam-effa, is either a superfluous
repetition or more probably a corruption os leodi silan-theja or
selon-desa. Leodi, A. S. leod, Latinized leudis, ‘⁴ weregild,'’ needs
no comment. Gelan is the weak gen. c. sing. of sila, often found in
the Frank. Psalms along with sila ,· also O. H. G. sela, but O. S.
stola, siole, agreeing, as we shall see presently, with seeola, scola,
seula, in other codd. os the Lex, and with M. D. sicle, N. D. ziele,
εἰεί, soul. Sela is here taken in the sense which we attach to
‘⁴ a living sou1,” i.e. a living being; cf. Skr. jiwa, soul, and a living
being. Selan theja is ‘⁴ burning os a living sou1,'’ i. e. os an inno-
cent living being, or as the text puts it, “ si aliquis arserit ’⁹ (³) ; it may
be a regular gen. case dependent upon leodi ,· “weregild for the
burning of a living being '’ = so many solidi. See further ᾇ 99.

§ 98. Andadil, read andadzf, incendium, which is either a femin.
like Goth. wrbhs, accusation (verb wrbhjan), or a masc. like A. S.
hete, O. S. heti, Ο. Η. G. haz, stands to ant-deson (and-deson) in

-—

(2) These who started the theory that the Germ. halle, salina, is horrowed
from Celtic hal, salt, were not aware that the Dutch equivalent of halle is
hcet, properly “a shed,'’ but elliptically the term for “salium’' Herewith
the Celtic etymology, and the fabric of “kulturhistorischffl theorice based
upon it, fall to the ground.

(⁹) The anomaly, real or apparent, in the “ Lautverschiebung,” visible in
thef= des, has its exact counterpart in O. H. G. rhemphan (demphen), comp.
with E. to damp, and kindsed words. This is not the place ω investigate
the cause of the anomaly. Suffice it to say that thes and def, if not originally
identical, have at least become identified.

(⁸) The notion of innocence, harmlessness, found in such expressions as
'¹ poor soul ’' and Dutch ¹¹ onnozele ziel,'' seems to be expressed by ‘⁴ dormi·
entes ” in the text; cf. Tit. XVIII.

the same relation as Goth. andabeit to the verb andbeitan ,· anda-
hafts to andhafjan ,⁶ andawaurdi to andwaurdjan, etc.

ὖ 99. Of exceptional importance is the first ξ in 6. Here again we
meet with a case of two readings having got mixed together. Seo-
lando etuas haldempa resolves itself into seolan do (variant seolan
deva), saldempa (variant haldempa). Seolan is another pronunciation
of selan in 2 (seej 97), and quite Saxon. Da, which has the stem
dawja, is a neuter, like stra in Frank. Ps. 62, 7; gen. strds (stem
strawja), D. struo, Ο. H. G. strae, N. H. G. stroh ; D. go, Ο. H. G.
gawi, whence Goth. gauja. Thissubst. db belongs to the Ο. S. verb
dasem, O. H. G. touuan, Ο. N. deya, etc„ which, with its offshootS,
yields the most common words sor dying and death in all Teutonic
languageS. Just as in the case of thes and defi we perceive the
anomaly that Ο. Η. G. possesses along with touuan not only douuen,
but also thouuen, which an occur in the MSS. of one and the same

author, otfrid (s. Graff, Spr. V, 340). Now, there can be little

doubt that the corresponding so-called root in Skr. is dha (dhu),
meaning to shake, vex, destroy, and also: to kindle‚ whence
dhuwana, fire. Dhuwana also denotes “the place os execution‚”
a meaning which shows a remarkable likeness to the most com·
mon use os the root in the Teutonic languages. When once
we know that dha also signifies to kindle‚ and dhuwana tire,
we must be satisfied that O. H. G. ka-dauuan, gidouuian, etc.
(5. Graff, Spr. V, 233), N. H. G. verdauen, D. verdouwen, to digest,
belong to the same root3 the Skr. word for digestion is udardgni,
fire of the belly, etc., or, more usually, simply agni, fire. We may
be sure that the same damian once denoted to quell, especially by
smoke. Radically the same is Ο. H. G. daubdn (with the interest-
ing vicarious form thaubbn), subigere, domare, 0. N. dejgfa, to
stupefy‚ D. dooven, to quench; cf. Skr. dhdpayati, to envelop in
damp, but also to damp, to vex (¹); see also the following para-
graphs.

The foregoing linguistic comparisons were necessary to justisy my
explanation os seolan da, which 1 would render by “ quelling os a
living being.’' The variant seolan deva we may explain in this way,
that in do the notion of damping‚ burning, is contained and was selt
as such, if not in the days os the scribes or compilers os the Lex, at
least in more ancient times. The English to quell (D. kwellen, to
vex, A. S. mellan, cwalu ,· D. kwaal, etc.-) originally refers exclu-
sively to the action of a blazing fire, as is proved by D. hwalm, damp
(but A. S. mealm, pernicies, cruciatus), Germ. qualm, and still
more distinctly by Skr. jwalati, to blaze, to burn.

ξ 100. Saldempa and haldempa practically amount to the same
thing, sal being A. S. sael. Dempais the nomen act. os dempan (for
dampian), Ο. H. G. demphan (again with a remarkable variation
themfan), suffocare, etc. (Gi-aff, Spr. V, 142); Ο. Fris. thempenc
means stifling, suffocating, smothen'ng. It is obvious that dempa of
the Malberg, as regards its initial consonant, agrees with E. damp
and, we may add, D. damp, smoke (²), and that the verb dampian,
according to the manner os its derivation, must have signified ‘⁸ to
cause to go up in smoke, to lay in ashes.’' In point os fact hal-
dempa does not differ from halthesathio (ᾗ 95), nor saldempa from
selanethefa (ἦ 96).

(²) A curione instance, out of many, of the connexion between the notioris of
burning, setting on fire, and of quenching, damping, quelling, is afforded by
Icel. bala, to burn (see Oxf. Dice), and also to quench, suppress (wanting in
the Dict.). In the newspaper Jsafold, of 4 Dec. 1876, wefind: “Ekki hasa
Spanverjar enn getad baelt uppreistina a. Koba?

(⁸) Pronounced with lingual d, answering etymologically to Engl. d.
