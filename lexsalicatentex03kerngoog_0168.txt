N OTES.

Goth. gards, O. S. gard, O. N. garon A. S. geard, O. H. G. gart,
eart,etc. Charde in 7, 83 c(h)ardo‚ once in 9, is either a dative or
the nomin. sing. of a weak substantive, Ο. H. G. ξαντα. The geni-
tive is govemed by antedio and texacha.

The former part of the eompound is a hard problem. Accord-
ing to Grimm’s suggestion (Pref. XXV), ole, ale would be the
Lithuan. awz'lys, a beehive in the tree. It seems to me dangerous to
make doubtful readings the basis of comparison, especially is by
comparison nothing is gained but the somewhat startling result
that the Franks used sundry words wholly at variance with those in
all other Teutonic languages‚ ancient and modern. If we had only
to etymologise, and not to criticise, the various readings of such bad
codices as those of the Lex, omnium consensu, happen to be, we
should be justified in proposing some etymology like the following:

’ ale, ele, ole recalls Skr. ali, “ a bee ” and ‘⁴ a strong drink.'’ Now,

another Skr. word, madhu, means “a strong drink, mead,'’ and
“honey,” and “a bee ” (1). The Teutonic equivalent os madhu,
viz„ A. S. meodu, etc., being synonymous with A. S. ealu, it would

not be strange if Frank. ale, ole, ele, were radically identical with·

ealu, and signified not only ‘⁶ ale, beer,'’ but also “ honey ’² or
“ a bee,” analogous to the Skr. ali. We might even draw the paral-
lel further and put down the following equation: A. S. bedr, Ο. N.
bjdrr : Skr. pz‘ydsha, Slavon. piwo = Engl. bee g: Lat. aptit.

Unfortunately the base of the etymological fabric, i. e. the proof
of the existence of such a word as ale, ole, ele in Frankish or any
other Teutonic language‚ is wanting. The various readingS, all
more or less corrupt, require a remedy, and this we discover in cod.
2, where, slightly disguised, the true reading has been preserved.
Not antedz'o leodardi, but antedio beochardis, is required; in 7, 8, 9
untedio beocharde(s) and taxacha biagartlulr ,· in 6 antede'o beochar-
dis and texacha b. ,· in 10 antedio beochardis and texacha beachar-
dls. Beo, bia, bea is A. S. beo, D. bie, bzsj, E. hee. In M. D. there
are many words for ‘⁶ apiarium ” and ‘⁴ alvearium ” ς the next
approach to beogard is bie-hof, sor hof is synonymous with gard ‚-
biegaard is lost. That, however, the very word beogard formerly
existed follows from the word biegaarder, apiarius (s. Kil. i. v.).

ᾗ 64. Texaga, in contradistinction to untedio, is robbery without
breaking, the stealing something osa certain value ‘⁶ foras tectum,” to
use the expression os the Lex. In so sar we may readily understand
why 1, afterwards 7, 8, 9, and finally 6 and 10, have the word where
there is question of such akind of robbery. Still the fine specified does
not agree, as the penalty os the texaga is 14ood., and not 6ood. The
latter, as we knOW, is termed leodardi, which, indeed, is shown by
2 and 6 in the third ἦ, and by 2 moreover in the fourth. T exara in
10 is of course to be corrected into texac(lz)a.

Andesitto (andesito) I take to be a femin. subst. formed like
Ο. H. G. henli-ezzo, or, perhaps, Ο. N. seta, from a supposed antsit·
tan (andsittan), Goth. andsitan, O. H. G. inarr’zzan, M. D. ont-rit·
ten. Ande is Goth. anda, used in composition with nouus, whereas
and is usual with verbs, In Goth., O. H. G„ and M. D., the verb
means ‘⁶ to scruple, to dread,'’ a meaning which cannot suit ande-
sitto in the Malberg. Since in eompounds the verbs standan and
sitan in all Teuton. languages express well-nigh the same idea, and

Goth. andstandan renders ᾰιὲθιστάναι ἀντικεῖσθαι and ἀντιλέγειν, we
shall be justified in assigning to andesitto the sense of denying, the
more so because in Ο. Fris. hine undsetta signifies ‘⁸ to resist, to op-
pose.’' NoW, undretta is the causative form osundsitta, Frank. *ant-
sittan, which, when construed with the reflexive pronoun (ltine), has
the same value as the neuter antsittan. Andesitto, i. e. oppositioni
in wordS, denial, refers to the words “ipso negante.'’ Is, by way
of amplification, the term was used to intimate a certain fine
imposed on one who ‘⁶ negando fuerit convictus,” as the Lex
Emend. puts it, then the word ‘⁴ sive '³ in 10 would be appropriate.
But I have grave doubts as to the correctness of the Malb. both os
ιο and 6, 7, 8, 9, because one would expect the fine specified in tln
last ᾗ of the Tit„ viz. 1200d., to have been indicated by another
term than leodardi. The latter is, at any rate, wrong; the word
required would be tui-leodardi, i. e. “twice leodardi, double leo-
dardi,” analogous to A. S. twibba Ο. Fris. twibete, thriluite, thr-ibe‘te,
thrimjeld, or something similar. Now, we happen to know from
Tit. LXV that a word sor ‘⁸ denial,” viz. sectln' (sedni), really
points to a fine of 1200d., so that we may conclude that the
synonymous andesitto has to serve the same purpose here, and that
it ought to stand in codd. 6-10 as the Malb. for the fine os 1200d.
The mistake ofputting it in an earlier paragraph may have arisen from
an original reading, ‘⁴ tu(i)-leodardi sive andeum,” having by over.
sight lost its first syllable. It should be understood that my sup-
positionis based upon the tenor os the text in 7, 8, 9, and 10, in
which leodardi is identified with 1200d. and separated from the
words “ damnum aestimatum.” If we keep to cod. 2, a some-what
different conclusion will be arrived at, since here leodardi belongs,
apparently, to “aestimatum damnum,” and is separated from the
fine of 1200d. It is just possible that in this case leodardi has
been rendered by “ aestimatum damnum ” agreeably to the original
meaning of the word, which I have tried to explain when trea'ting
of its etymology. But even if this were the true reason for its
appear-ing in § 8 of 2, it would not interfere with the thesis that
andesitto should have been put as the Malb. to “1200d.” In
other words, suppose we added the Malb. in ᾧ 8 os 6, the text
would run thus: ‘⁶ Si quis vero per inimicitiam—convietus testibus
fuerit, damnum aestimatum reddat, Malb. leodardi, et insuper,
Malb. andesz'tto, sunt den. 1200,” etc.

ἦ 66. Scuto in 2 and 9, schoto in 10 (better scutto, schotto), looks lilae
a regular 3rd pers. sing. pres. tense of the subjunctive mood. Frank.
scutton, excutere, occurs Gl. L. 812 in the preter. scurta, excussit;
the infin. scatron, Ps. 63, 53 O. H. G. scozdn, scozzrin, pellere;
farscuzsan, pellere (cs. Graff, Spr. VI, 562, sq.); D. schutten is both
“ pellere, excutere,’' and ‘⁴ (pecus) subsistere, sistere, in septum
agere, includere et pignoris loco retinere ε capere et detinere pecus
alienum '’ (cf. Kil. i. v.). I venture to say that this paraphrase of
schuttera in Kiliaen, the correctness of which is proved by the word
being used in exactly the same sense in the modern language‚ is a
more accurate rendering os the Frank. scuton (scutton) than the
Latin text of the Lex. Hischoto in 7, chrir(cu)to in 8, contain the
prefix hi, chi = gi ,· cf. Ο. S. hiburilicuru, Mei-S. Gl. 12; for dial.
O. H. G. hi, chi, see Weinhold, Isidorus, p. 73. It is difficult to
decide whether excuto in 2, excoto in 6, is a mere Gallo-romance
writing for scuta, scoto, or is intended to represent escuto, escoto =
ascuto, iscoto. The form e = ge, along with i = gi, is not strange ς it
is the usual one in O. Fris. and N. Saxon dialects; i is known from
the Mers. GL, e. g. iwegde, idrimde (cf. Heyne, Kl. D. XV), and
M. D., e. g. imane = gemanc (Maerlant, Naturen Bloeme, V, 259).
It is only the Gallo-romance spelling xc which creates some doubt.
