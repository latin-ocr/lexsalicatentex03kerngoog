NOTES. TITT. XLIV. XLV.

Versus Gnomici (Grein, 2, 347): “Ides sceal hire sreond geseccan
[i. e. gesecean} paet hi man bedgum gebycgest’

Where rep and magr, bedg are used in the plural we may
render it by money, the singular indicates at one time a dowry, at
another money or a shield. The prescription in the Lex that the
future husband of the widow scutum habere debet, as well as ‘⁸ tres
solidos et denarium ’' decidedly points to the fact that rep, in
former times at least, must have combined the various meanings οἱ
baugr ,⁴ the shield is one of the symbols of the idea rep. The
singular rep is a dowry, in the sense in which Ο. H. G. minemo,
A. S. veetiam, Ο. Fris. wetma, etc., occurs in the Lex Burg.:
‘⁴ Mulier quae ad secundas nuptias traditur, wittemo eius a prioribus
parentibus mariti vindicetur ” (Ι).

Rnspus, repas (the b in reibus, rebus, is not Frankish, but semi-
French) in the rubric is, in my opinion, the Frank. plural. Were
it otherwise, the spelling reipusse in the rubric of 8 would be un-
intelligible. The ei instead of e may be dialectic, though it occurs
here in codices which elsewhere (ε. Tit. XXXII) show e. This
circumstance, combined with the fact that even cod. 6 writes in
Latin eique to express aeque (ᾖ 2) leads us to the conclusion that
the ei is simply a device to render the sound os ee, Goth. ai, as dis-
tinguished from e, Goth. i. In other wordS, the spelling with ei is
due rather to the peculim-ities of the popular Romance tongue,
into which the term was received, than to any dialectic influence.

Reszus m'hilsinus in 1, etc., if it be not wholly misplaced, must
convey the meaning os payment of a fine to the person to whom the
dewy-money, the wittemo is due. On analysing the Malberg we
find that lasz'rtus in 10 interchanges with las-thus in 6, lesinus,
lessinus, lem-inus, lis-simus in the codd. of the family os 7-9,
zZu'rrus in 1. We know that Iasina in 10 is a dial. form os loosina,
and that lesina in 7·9 shows the Umlaut (²) os oo, better spelt oe,
or, as in French and Dutch, eu ‚· this eu is intended by the corrupted

en (θ) in 83 z· is another spelling for the same Umlaut. In short, '

ldsinus = leus-inus (las-inus, Its-inus) is A. S. ljsness, lisness, solutio,
redemptio. In 6 the word seems to be altanus, i. e. A. S. alysness,
redemptio; in 10 it must be the same or chaldu'nus (galesinus)

from galdsian, A. S. gelysan, liberari (s. Bosw. Dict. i. v.). The
double s in les-rinus may be correct, because in M. D. both loosen
and tossen are used in the sense οἱἿ ‘solvere'’ 3 N. D. tossen, to
release, redeem. In Ο. S. cf. Idsian, alcist'an, liberare in the He-
liand3 eruere in Gl. Prud. 5113 for Ο. Η. G. see Graff, Spr. 11,

2 .
⁷22in 6, haec οι· hamb in 10 and nz‘cho, nih, etc„ in the other

codices are all corrupt: the word intended is see, saech (sech),
vz'cho, vihu, Frankish os the Psalms and Gl. L. fe, fio, fiu, pecus,
pecunia3 0. H. G. veho, seha, fiko, filiu. Vihulosinus, vicho-
Iesinus, see-alffinus, sech-aldsz'nus (or sech-galcisinus), means re-
demption or payment of money, os a see, if we like3 it is pretty
much what is called in O. N. flgjalii, a payment, fine, Niala, 111,

(²) ef. Graff, Spr. 1, 777. Graff ernoneously supposes that from the t in the
A.S. weotuma we should expect a z in H. G. , for the t has developed out of
d before m according to rule 3 bodun becomes bottom ,· bodl, boel, etc. So too
in Frisian. It is different in Saxon and Dutch, where we find wedene,
weenoe ,- bodem, etc.

(θ) The Umlaut of 8 (Goth. o) iu also represented by e ,- from two charters,
Am. 796 and 805, we leam that the father of Ludger is called Hddger
(N. S. Roediger)3 and'in a charter aa). 793 Rodgaer (Sloet, Oork. No. 16

‘⁶ pecunialis emendatio.'’ Cf. Alfr. LL. introd. 29: “ Gis paere

Reipus, i. e. reepus in the Malb. is the genit. sing„ the ending
us answering to Ο. S. as, es,- cf. rencus, Tit. XXXV. The
whole phrase may be rendered by dowry· ·fine, payment in money in
compensation of the dower.

ᾇ 222. Uuz'cinlrittolo in 1, uuedresitelo in 2 means either refractory
or resi-actoriness. In the former alternative· it would be the weak
masc. nom. of the adjective miirin’ttol, medresitel, derived with the
frequentative and intensive suffix ol, il, al, A. S. ol, Goth. ab, uls,
Ο. Ν. ull, M. D. and N. D. el, etc.; e. g. Goth. slahals, minuis ,·
Ο. Η. G. scama13 A. S. sretol, sprecol‚ sagol, etc. (¹). The adjec-
tive malinis-mol, wedresitel, contumax, from the neuter verb witin·-
sinan, wedresitan, does not materially differ from the N. H. G.
widersetzlich, resractory, from siclt muersetzen ,· for the neuter
verb and the reflexive form of the causative convey virtually the
same idea. If widriu‘ttolo were “ refractoriness ” or ‘⁶ contu-
macia,” then it would answer to N. H. G. muersetzung or waller-
setslichkeit, and probably be the dative of a femin. abstract noun in
ia, the Ο. H. G. equivalent of which would be widririzsali.

Uut'dnlrtholo, uuidresathalo in 6 and ιο should be widnktalo (or
artelo), wt'cirestah, i. e. either resistance, A. S. wabersteall (cf. Ο. N.
viUrstaKa and D. wederstand, resistance, renixus) in the dative
instr. case, or an adjective coordinate with it.

1t is not easy to decide whether uuz'aeirositelo, uuz'drou'thelo,
uuidrosilito in 7-9 represents wssm'ttelo, «ritilo or wt‘aeirostelo (for
mab), because st has more than once been expanded into sit in
this family of MSS. 3 e. g. heszram> sor bestalio in Tit. XLII 3 sita·
habim for stalahiu, in Tit. XXXVIII (XLII). The absence of
any variant with the vowel a and the i in sildo (read sitilo) of 8 in-
duce me to prefer widrosittelo‚ «cinito, i. e. the readIng agreeing in
the main with that in 1 and 2. As to the d for »³158 in wt'clm
(Goth. myra), widn, wz'dre, wedre cf. the spelling wider in the
Heliand alternating with wither, etc.

ᾗ 223. Andutheoco in 6, anduutheocho in ιο willagree with the
tenor os the text is we read anduntheeto or andum-laceto. And is
to be taken in the sense of “ adversely, perversely, wrongly,” as in
Ο. N. andvitni, contradictory testimony, such as is contrary to
law3 andmarki, a fault, flaw3 andhaeli, monstrosity, absurdity (cf.
Tit. LI). Unt (und), M. D. and N. D. ont, is interchangeable
with ant (and), and un also is admissible because it would answer
to A. S. on = and, e. g. in onbeddan, M. D. ombieden (onbieden) 3
N. D. ontbieden, A. S. onhdtan, M. D. ontheeteit, Ο. H. G. ant-,
intheisan. Andunt-heeto or andan-chata, if it be a nominative

,and an agent, denotes “ one who unlawsully promises or invites ;”

but if it be an abstract noun it means ‘⁴ unlawful invitation,” from a
femin. stem -lzeeta, beelim Owing to the indefinite character os
unt (und) it is by no means impossible that the verb untheetan de·
noted something quite different, vis. to call away, to challenge
away. The interpreters of the Law seem to have taken the Malb.

in the sense of inviting.
