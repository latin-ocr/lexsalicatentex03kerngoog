making great bustle, an uproar in a field.”

Sit is a corrupt sunt.

ἦ 284. Agsoniis, combined with saca'om'is’, would lead to an original
reading sac-soniis. Sonia being a variety of sunnis, and sac mean-
ing ⁸⁸ causa ’', the compound may be rendered by ⁸⁸ judicial lawful
excuse, &pedamentum acubuis- ’', in other words ⁸⁸ causa sontica.”
Ι ought to add that a term aaroni (achatem), from ackti, perse-
cutio (cf. O. Η. G. achtunga, persecutio; Ο. Fris. achtene), and
sonia would also be suitable. On comparing Tit. 1 we perceive
that the terms achtz'an, bannire and mannire are not always scru-
pulously kept separate, and the occurrence of the very word aftena
- ahtena in the Malb. of Tit. 1 tends to corroborate my opinion
that annania is the word intended in this Tit. An additional sup-
port to this view is given by the term echtndt in the sachsenspiegel
(cf. Grimm, R. A. 848), for ndd and sunnea are synonymous, and
echt is a regular development of alai. Now, an homonymous echt
means ⁸⁸ legitimus,” a circumstance which has led to the formation,
by popular etymology, of the M. H. G. ehast nde (i. e. sunnis), as if
echindt were echte nbt (cs. Grimm, R. A. 848).

It would not be at all strange ifsacsonium and actsonium had been

equally used.

ᾗ 285. Chanecreudo, canecreuto, anecrenodum is, 13 my opinion,
the Latinized dat. of channechrlnod or channeclenod, in which
chamae stands for chande, a hand. As hreni and clem· are but
varieties of one and the same word, it is, to a certain degree, a
matter of indifference whether we prefer to read clenna or chremd,
M. D. clenode, N. D. kleinood‚ M. H. G. kleindt, blancae, a
trinket, treasure, present. The compound answers pretty much to
M. Η. G. hantgr'ft, strena3 cs. hantgdbe, arrha. It is remarkable
that in M. H. G. along with hantgdbe we also find ang-dhe, arrha,
and it is by no means impossible that anecrenod in 1 1 is its counter-
part, so that ane would be no corrupt form of hande, but the pre.
position. There being no trace in the Malb. of any other form os
hande in which nd has suffered assimilation, it may even be conjec-
tured that the existence of two synonymous words handeclenod
(nandechrenod) and aneclenod (anechremd) has given rise to a
compromise, so to say, between both, the result of which was
the corrupt forms in 1 and 2.

ᾗ 286. Dealaptas (read thualaptas and pron. malaflas) is the
nom. pl. of maleft, properly twelsth‚ but here used in the sense of
⁸⁸ a member of the college os twelve, a duodecinwir ”, just like the
Ο. Fris. tolfta (Fris. LL. 476, 9), except that the latter follows the
weak declension. Talenms in 11 is an error for tualevtas, a bad
spelling for tualeflas. The Latinized causa tualesta is an inaccurate
rendering os some eompound like &celest-saca ; tualeft, 1. e. tasa-
lefli, differing from hcalefl, stem tua-lefta, and meaning a dozen;
cs. Ο. N. Mfftar ὲυίδν, 3 verdict of the duodecimviri. stoalapus,
i. e. malasar, is O. Fris. tol-va, twelve men, in meaning identical with
tvgftar, Frank. mlestus.

Suam mala etc. is corrupt to such an extent that it will be safest
to abstain from all conjectures.

ᾇ 287. Chreodiba (i. e. breodiba), creubeba (read chreudeba), creo-

ὁ 290. The words sami'tltio reddant, in 1, are, in my opinion, the
original wording of the text, notwithstanding their being slightly
corrupt. We ought to read se munnio (or, perhaps, m'tthio)
reddant. Se reddere is the F rench se rendre, to betake oneself.
It is immaterial whether we prefer reading witthio or think it safer
to cling to mittlu'o, because in either case the notion conveyed by
the word remains the same, namely “lawsully” or “legally.’'
The reviser, whose hand we can trace in cod. 11, did not under-
stand mitti (or witti), but felt that the idea he wished to express by
iure was necessary, and consequently added this word. It is also
possible that his source had mittt'nt'u (01· wittiniu), which would
lead him just as easily to his conjecture. 1 think we ought to
understand mi‘ttlu'o in sect. 7 of 1 13 the same sense of ⁸⁸ legally,”
⁸⁸ in legal form. ” The Goth. dat. vitoda is used in the same way
