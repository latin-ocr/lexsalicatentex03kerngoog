NOTES. TIT. VII.

os each clement has to be substituted in each particular case. Even
perfectly clear words, like O. H. G. poumsalcho, D. boomvalk, are
ambiguous, sorpoum, boam, means ‘⁸ a tree,” as well as “ a bearn, a
bar, a shast,'' so that the perspicuity of the compound is but an
apparent one. It is only by comparing poumsalcbo with synony-
mous terms like walffalcho, wiltfalcbo, witeflzlcho, that we shall
be justified in taking boom, poam, inthis particular case in the sense
of ‘⁸ a tree, wood.”

It is doubtful whether spat-cavari contains the word spari, A. S.
spere, etc„ allied to Ο. H. G. sparm, tignus, D. spur, a spar,
perch; E. spur, etc. This much seems certain, that φανίωαή, on
account of its very form, oennot be derived from Goth. spat-wa,
Ο. Η. G. sparo, E. sparmw, though in some way or other the
words may be connected, in so sar as both may be reduced to the
same etymon. 1 think that spur-imari, be it original or the result
of popular etymology, is virtually the same as walhapuc and ξεῖν·-
sdlki, allowance being made for the difference os species. In the
dial. M. D. mane, spumaue (cs. Kil. i. v. sper-maen), commonly
sperwere, sporeware, etc. (cf. above), the latter part of the com-
pound does not differ, at least phonetically, from walanam, the
Malb. to “accipiter’' in 6. In short, 1 identify wale, as to its
meaning, with spem· and spat-ro, and, in a certain sense, with geit- ,-
consequently we get the equation spat-:warte = walewane.

The foregoing discussion has prepared the ground sor the propo-
sition that ωτι- orto =uerthi (?) is a synonym os wale, spari,
spano. There is no doubt that a similar word is contained in
mar-thoda osa, for which we may confidently read wart- or war-tb-
sogla. sse syllable or is a contractiori of war, war, wor, or wer.
The various readings point to a stem war-thia (or τηαν-Μία ?)‚ ortbia
(or orhtia ?)‚ urthia (or urhtia Ρ). In a similar relation stands
Goth. aurts, herba, to Ο. H. G. wan, pl. παντί, A. S. wyrt (cf.
Grimm, D. G. 111, 371); Frank. wirte, olera (Gl. L. 1032); uani
(i. e. wurti), herbam (Gl. L. 1068). Now, Goth. waurts, Ο. H. G.
τουπ, D. wortel, A. S. ταφή (wiri, war-t, vert), wyrttruma, etc.,
‘⁶ a root ” stands for murhts, as may be inserted from ἕστασαν-Μαί =
ἐῤῥιζωμένοι (Ephes. 3, 18). Thus it appears that it is a derivative
from a verbal base wsb, to hew, the preS. tense of which in Skr. is
wsfcati ,· part. pers. pasS. wrkrsa .· hence the Skr. wrksha, a tree.
Waurhti, a root, is the same word, except in the difference of suffix,
That the word “root '’ may be derived from averb denoting hewing,
will appear obvious when we remember how often in Skr. we find
wrfcati (or chinatti) malam (cs. Pet. Dict. i. v. wrafc); equally in-
disputable is Skr. wfkslta, a tree. Now, iu A. S. vyrt not only
means ‘¹ herba ’³ and “radix” but also ‘⁶ tree,” for in wyri-weard
‘⁴ hortulanus ” (St. John, 20, 15) wyrt does not mean “herbs” or
“ root8,'’ but the plantation in general. And, as if to complete the
coincidence between the above Frankish forms and those in A. S.,
the latter possesses the well-known origani, orcerd (GenesiS, ii. 8),
E. archani, which most distinctly and decidedly is a trec-garden,
D. boomgaard, Germ. baumgarten. Another form os this ortgeard
is A. S. wyrtgeard in Ps. 143, 16 (Ettm. Lex. 98).

To sum up the various items os information, 1 conclude that in
Frankish there were two cognate forms, the one contracted‚ the
other not, agreeing with A. S. ort and wyrt (wer-t, wart), and sig-
nifying‚ according to circumstances, a tree, a plant, a root. We
shall find this assertion confirmed in Tit. XXVII. Ortfogal, etc„
on account os its etymology, may signify, to use the expressions os
the Lex, a bird, ‘⁶ de arbore,’' and “ de pertica,'' and even “ de
hort0.” If the Malb. ortzfuglffi ortsogla‚ where 6, ιο, 7, 8, 9 have
it aster ‘⁸ grus aut cicenus domesticus,” be no mistake, we shall

461

have to assume that orti was in this instance taken as ‘⁶ a garden‚'’
or that the Latin translation is a sailure.

ἦ 56. Returning to the beginning of the Tit. we first come acrossthe
Malb. horhut in 2. Is it a corrupted hortsugl ἒ Not unlikely, sor
otherwise cod. 2 would stand entirely isolated. Yet 1 will not omit
saying that the ending ut, as well as ot, it, is not rare in the names of
birds; e. g. M. D. scuvuut, sco-mut (¹), N. D. schuzfuit‚ a screech-
owl; M. D. cucuut, a cuckoo ; A. S. gand, ganet, sulica; D.
kievit, kiewit, E. percit, and the like. Hocttcla in 7, 8, 9, when
compared with hor-ttfuda (a misread barufula, orttsucla) in the
same texts, leaves no doubt as to its being a mutilated hoanugla ,-
the h is here due to graphical cockneyism; the real-h sound is gene·
rally represented by cb in these three codiceS.

ἦ 57. Hymm's sith in 1 stands wholly aloos from the other texts, yet
the letters ol* the word are similar to those in the name for a cock,
viz. channaswido. We may go further and contend that hinni is a
persectly intelligible variation os channa (chunia), for in M. D.
hinne and henne, E. hen, are equally used. Swith is even a better
orthography than ποῖά. As hinnis-with is required by the etymo-
logy (about which more in ᾗ 60), and a variation os it really occurs
in other codiceS, though in another and more appropriate place,
I feel satisfied that we have to read hynnirwith(a), and that the
oldest text 1 furnishes us here with an example os an error as great
as that by which the same authority causes the aquatic bird sundo-
leno to make its appearance in the company os bees,

ἦ 58. Wez‘ano in 10, neg-anus in 7, 8, 9, is undoubtedly, as Grimm
has pointed out (Pres. XXIV), O. H. G. τοῖο, wtjgv, weho, “ milvus'',
and also “ibis ” ; M. D. wuwe, N. D. wouw, a kite. Since
O. H. G. weho is paraphrased in the gloss-aries (cf. Graff, Spr. 1,
643) by “ibis ” and wego by ‘⁸ milvuS,” it is but natural that, as in
10 we find ortfogla sive ωείαηο, the former term was thought,
rightly or not, to be applicable to an aquatic bird called “ grus aut
cicenus (cygnus) domesticus.’' Weiano looks as if it were either a
regular genit. pl. or a dat. sing. with an additional ο (cf. the re·
marks on oxeno, Tit. III). Wganus may be a mistake sor «ce-
gam, atisin g from a final ο and us being sounded alike, or nearly so,
in the semi-Latin os the period. There is, however, such a num-
ber os derivatives from wilto in Ο. Η. G„ as mehir, wilzil, vigil,
mabilla (prov. N. Sax. in Drente : wichel) wannowehe, wanmm-
wachel ; M. D. wannewaeyer ; N. H. G. wannewciher, wanne-
weihe (cs. Graff, Spr. I, 643 3 Grimm, G. D. S. 1, 50) that a nomi-
native wegan, a genit. weganus (= weganes) would by no means be
surprising.—Antedio (in 6, etc.) is the term for a certain kind of
thest with breaking, the fine sor which is 1800d. ς the explanation
os it will be attempted in the next Title.— Weszpe in 6, wairpe in
10, look suspicious; perhaps wetgge, weihloe (cf. Ο. Η. G. mikil),
or wezhre (cf. O. H. G. webir, D. wouwer) is intended.

Naolgfocla in 2 is the mutilated temnant os (inempta, onhsogla =
weiano sive ortfogla in 10.

ᾗ 59. Sundolino in 1, sundoleno in 2, s[unt]dilino in 6, sondolino in
7, ,fundelino in 8, sundlenoin 10 is the name of some tarne aquatic
bird or sorts of such birds. Sund is manifestly A. S. suad, swim·
ming; sea passage; sea ; O. N. suna, etc. If the reading sundleno
in 10 be correct, the word has been formed analogously to M. D.
merlin, smerlin, N. D. smerlzjn, E. merlin, but suntdillno would
rather induce us to come to a contrary conclusion, viz„ that sundo-
lino stands for sunddoleno ; in sunt-ailino the final d has passed
