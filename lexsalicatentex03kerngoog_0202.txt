NOTES. TIT. XLVI.

ὖ 224. The Latinized hac-suminus, etc., shows itself in so many
aspects that, with due allowance for palpable errors, we cannot but
acknowledge the existence of various collateral forms of the term
in Frankish. For the substantive, whence the compound verb is
derived, are admissible: samm, sadm, sathana, fathom, sathana,
and even the very advanced form sam ; A. 8. Ῐωδηι, fathom, am-
plexus: sinus; potestas; Ο. H. G. fudam, fadum, thread3 Ο. Ν.
foe6mr; O. S. sathmos, fadmas (ph), etc. The particle must
have been at·, otherwise it is difficult to explain hac, ac, which
being neither Latin nor Frankish can only be a misread σὺ. Itis
very likely that there existed a variation ant or an; perhaps also
a; even as is not impossible, though affatomiae in the Lex Em.
may, of course, stand for adfathomiae. Affathomian, as well as
am, ant-, asathmian, by itself says nothing more than ‘⁸ to bring
to the fathm ”; whether the fathm was to be one's own or that of
another is not expressed. Hence the verb may just as well signify to
adopt, as to transfer, bestow, convey to another. Equally ambiguous
is the Ο. Ν. term which corresponds to our word, viz. skeyta,
which in the sense of ‘⁸ caring for ” evidently has developed from
the notion of ‘⁴ taking to one’s own bosom, to heart ”3 but in the
other sense in which it occurs in the laws, namely, of transferring
land by donation, it has arisen from the idea of bringing into
another’s lap, power. At first sight it would appear that the D.
term den holm schieten is not ambiguous, for Kiliaen i. v. explains
it by ‘⁸ infestucare‚ confirmare et stabilire alienationem sive ven·
ditionem traditione fustis, virgae, hastae, calami aut stipulae.''
But, on considering the meanings of schiston, to shoot, it is far
from certain that the original sense of atfatItmian, skeyta, den
holm schieten was so onesided as it became in later times3 cf. Lex
Rip. tit. 48 ς adoptare in hereditatem vel adfatimire ; cf. also Capit.
Ludov. Primi (col. 419 of the present work) X and cp. Ο. H.G.
grfadiman with A. S. saedman, amplecti (Grein, Gloss. i. v.). As
to skeyta‚ smung, scotatio, Ι refer to Oxf. Dict. i. vv. and Grimm,
R. A„ 1103 121, sqq.

Affatlaomia, unless it stand for adfathomia, can only mean the
giving up, abdication.

ᾗ 22 5. Les, lis, leniri, leis-a, leis—according to semi-Latin spel-
ling laisus, lesus, lues-tas, lad-rus, laesa, etc.—was undoubtedly
synonymous with sathm and Ο. Ν. skaut, the sheet of a eloth,
airt, outskirt; sheet of a sailg skirtz lap, bosom3 A. S. scedt, D.
schoot. It is evidently allied to O. H. G. lesa, ruga3 in diminutive
form Ο. Fris. lesoka or lesoka ; M. D. leese, orbita ς waghenleese,
O. S. waganlausa, Gl. Prud. 708; Ο. Η. G. wagnnlez'sa (λαῶν,
-lesa); Ο. Η. G. lista, limbus, fimbria; D. lzjrt, A. S. list, etc.
A connexion between Goth. sapa, a hedge, and sathm, such as is
hinted at in Oxf. Dict. i. v. fabmr, is not improbable, and would
fully explain how the tract of country going by the name of Kinne-
les and Kome-mare or Kin-hem in the Middle Ages (at present
Kennemer land) was known to the Romans as a bordei-land in-
habited by the Canninefates (i. e. Kannine-fatheis, the men of
Kannine-fathos); for mare, A. S. moere, gemoere is border, out-
skirt. It is from les, lecs = Ο. Ν. skaut, scaedt, schoot, sheet=faJ>a,
sathm that the French tisim is to be derived, rather than from the
cognate lest.

The use of such comprehensive, nay ambiguous words like
fathm and les, lectt, lenita is certainly not accidental, but inten-
tional. In all ancient laws, as well as in the religion and philo-
sophy of the primitive period of mankind, the poetical clement
or sentiment predominates, and it is essential to poetry that

the words used should be as pregnant, as full of meaning, as
possible.

ᾗ 226. Beod (bend), in the fifth section of the present chapter, in
would-be Latin beodus, beudus, is the Ο. S. baba, bied, A. S.
hebd, Goth. biuds, Ο. H. G. hiet, piot, Ο. Ν. bjofir, a table, and
requires no comment.

ᾗ 227. Ante theoda aut thungr’num, as it stands in our next
section, is a hybridic formula, a mixture of Salic and Latin. M
or theodo· rs necessarily a notion of the same category as changium.
There can be no question here of the well· known theod, theada,
people, because a phrase such as‘ ‘before the people or (and) the
thunginus” would be nugatory. modo, theudo is either wholly
identical with 0. S. thiodo, dominus (Heliand 138, 12), or it is
formed analogously to A. S. leda, princeps (cf. Greiu, Gloss. i. v.).
In either case it is a slight variety of A. S. pedden, palaea, dominus.
Goth. pindarus, etc. Words which have the character of nouus
proper, like God, Lord, showin Ο. Η. G„ M. H. G.. and M. D. the
peculiar declension of nouns proper3 thus the accus. of Ο. Η. G.
got, cot is gvtan, coam ,¹ truhtin has tundnau. In M. D., in
similar cases, the final n is regularly wanting; hence the accus. of
god is gode, in the same manner as e. g. Adam, Petrus have
Adam, Patr-use. In Ο. S. both forms, with and without final n,
are equally used, e. g. Laeana-ee and Lanam-ran, and the like.
The M. D. form points to a Salic a ‚· and no matter whether the
nominative was theod or theode, the accus. would in any case be
theoda. This theory is confirmed by facts. In chartei-s of the
Frank. period we find that the accus. and even the genit. of proper
nouns in ο may end ina. Acharter ofA.n. 720 (¹)has: “Ego
Ebroinus comes, filius Oda quondam, ” · i. e. ‘⁶ the son of the late
Odo. ” Further on Oda occurs as an accusative, whereas a F ranhsh
dative pl. appears in Megmum (Megen), in loco Rinltan‘m (at
present Rinderen). For the M. H. G. the corresponding forms
in e are given by Weinhold' ιιι his Mittelhochdeutsche Grammatik,

ἕξις-,σω thewords‘ ‘inmallo ante regem’ 'int and 6 we mustcon-

clude that the translatore thought it fit to render theod, theodo,
princeps, dominus, by ‘⁸ rex.” The purport of the phrase ‘⁶ in
mallobergo'’ is far stom clear. Does it mean “on the malberg
(law-hill), Ο. Ν. Ib'gberg”, or ‘⁶ in the malberg, i. e. in the original
text of the law ’' Ρ If we adopt the latter alternative, the phrase
ante theoda aut thungr‘num (or treug-ino) could not be called
hybridic, but corrupted. It is conceivable that one or two genuine
Salic words were mistaken for Latin, on account of their accidental
similar-ity to words in this language. If we suppose the Frank.
phrase to have run in this way: ant theoda otho (or and) thungin,
the error of the scribes must seem a trifle in comparison with the
other feats they have achieved throughout the Lu. Ant (and) as
a preposition in the sense of “ in presence of, with,” is extremelyrare
and could for this very reason the more easilybe mistaken for Latin.
Yet it occurs in a strikingly similar expression in Caedmon's
Genesis 13: “haefdon gleAm and drehm and heora ordii-umen?
And ordflumn, i. e. ante, apud dominum, is synonymous with
anttheoda. Anteudain 2, anteodain 7 stands for attendat, the
change of th into t being due to assimilation, like Ο. 8. ant tat, an-
tat, for ant that, M. D. ontat sor ont dat (properly ontthat). The
diphthong ea in theada answers to ia (for older ιο, oo) which is not
uncommonly met with· ιιι Ο. 8., Ο. Fris. and Hig’h- Frankish.
