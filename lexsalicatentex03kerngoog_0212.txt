NOTES.

Quite apart stands recemburgi in 9. This looks indeed suspi-
ciouS, and may be a conjecture of the scribe sor cherenburg. The

· connexion between 7 and 9 is so close that wherever we perceive

material differences in their readings, we can only account sor them
by supposing that one of the scribes has been tampering with his
original.

ἔ 262. Humnirfith seems to be the term for the fine which m the
present case amounts to 2500d. Feta, whether it stands for ῥητὴ
or sor fihth =fifllc, may mean‘ ‘a pentad‚” Ο. N. fimt; cs. Skr.
pankti, and as to the absence of the k the Pali panti, and Latin
quintus. If it were quite certain that fith stood for ῙῖΙιτΙι, fiht, we
could not find anything strange in it, first because ft and kt are
frequently interchanged, especially in the Low Frankish dialects3
secondly, because the guttural in the word is older than the
labial. It is not necessary to appeal to the Ο. Fris. fich, which
occurs twice in the Fris. LL., 173, 14, for, although undoubtedly
a numeral is intended, its reading and meaning are not cer-
tain; suffice it to observe that the double form, one with a gut-
tural the other with a labial, in the final syllable of ‘⁴ five,” both
appear in Greek and Celtic. In the Chunnas (see ἦ 301) we per-
ceive that where one cod. has fitme (read fimte or finve) the other
shows uueth, a most corrupt reading, indeed, but pointing to vucth
= vicht or vich, rather than to anything else.

Supposefith to mean a pentad, viz. of chunna’s, how shall we
explain humm's ,θ With great diffidence Ι propose to read sumatis,
quinquies, Such a form is not impossible, but I am not aware that

. multiplicatives upwards of thrice are formed in any Teutonic tongue

in such a manner.
§ 263. Faras in 6, which means both “ stria” and “meretrix,’'

is . substantially the M. D. var-ende mjf, incantatrix, venefica; strix
volatica; meretrix, and probably connected with Ο. N. fdrskona,
a hag. I consider the final s to be the suffix expressive of con-
tempt: it occurs also in A. S. hoegeS, hoegtes, D. heks, G. hexe, a
hag; Ο. Η. G. hams, hams, naza, stri0‚ suria.

ς 264. Granderba, if the reading bc correct, can hardly be any-
thing but a compound grand-derha, nequitiae audax (mulier), from
grand, Ο. N. grand, evil doing, guile, and derbi, 0. S. derbi, O. N.
djarfr, audax. Allied are A. S. grondor, guile, nefariousneSS, in
grandom-air (Juliana 271) and Grendel in the Beowulf. Granderba
was not unlikely applied more specially to a personage akin to
Grendel’s mother, the man-eating hag in the A. S. poem.

j 265. Turne claras-0, in 6, is not quite clear, though more
intelligible than the Latin text, corrupted as it is by some revisers,
who, not perceiving that decorticare is not by any means the Latin
decorticare, but an inaccurate spelling for decurticare or decurtare,
to curtail, introduced all kinds of nonsense into the text itself and
its rubric. Ι suppose we ought to read curve chr-oso, A. S. curse
horse ‘⁴ secaverit equo,” some word sor “ tail‚” let us say tagl,
having been lest out. Cur-ve is the 3rd pers. pret. subj. of cer-van,
D. ker-ven, A. S. ceorfan.

§ 266. Sectlu‘s is the genit. sing. of a fem. secthi (sectati), denial.
It answers to O. Fris· sekwird, denial, opposed to jechth'rd, con-
fession, and is a regular derivative from a verb sacan or sacian,
O. Fris· (bose-cha, to deny; cf. A. S. andsamn, wiUsacan, etc.

would suit just as wellin Tit. LXVII. For the meaningless mor·
chamo Ι would read wore-kalne, Ο. Ν. m'rgilndr, a corpse on a gal·
lows. Cf. Ο. Η. G. wurgian, D. morgen, strangulare (¹), Ο. S.
‘marg-27, wun'gil, a halter, Heliand 157, 21: “'Was imu God abol-
gan, that he unu selbon tho, Simon warhte; hneg tho an herusel,
an hinginna, warag an mugil.”Ana10gously to Ο. N. gdlgndr, a
synonym of virgiludr (¹), the Frankish term was probably not
applied exclusively to corpse8‚ but also to suspended persons who
by some accident remain living. At least this is the only way in
which Ι could interpret Grfigas 2,131: “ef maUr er hengjvr, oc
heitirsagalgnfir. Ocscal pessa menn alla(scil. smdr, gmfha'r,
etc.) gjalda nik-oldam pdat peir hafi lis sitt, sva sem 'peir se
vegnirss

The terms we meet with in 7-10 (see Tit. XLI) may be easily
recognised as synonyms of worchalno in spite of their corrupt
condition. Sabancbeo, cambacheo, rabanal are all misreadings for
rahancbw, rabangal, a body hanging on a yard. Ra is Ο. N. ra‘,
D. ra, Dan. raa, Swed. νᾶ, a sail-yard. Cf. also the Ο. Η. G.
galcraha, mentioned by Grimm, Pref. LII. Hancheo is O. N.
hangi, a body hanging on a gallows. Hangal, otherwise spelt
hanchal (so to read instead of banchal) is formed like Lat. pendulus,
and a shorter expression for rakancloeo, rabangal.

ᾗ 269. Aspelli, which we'find in § 1, may, according to its appa·
rent etymology, just as well mean‘ ‘given to perdition, undone,” as

“given up” ;cf. Ο. N. spilla, to spoi134peuand23a spoiler; D.
φαῖσι, to waste, squander away, Ο. Η. G. spade, effusio; despe-
ratic.

For sae-tat, sa (in cod. 11) we should read fiat. Wherever an
active form is erroneously used as a passive it is not the fault of the
serni-Latin but of a scribe.

LXXII.

ἦ 270. The Latinized acharius, adhen'm· points to a Frank. stem
ant· (or an-) chasia, -Ιιεεία, The e is the Umlaut of the older a,
but it is not clear whether the radical vowel isa long or a short one.
I suppose that chdsz‘, hesi is the A. S. Ιιω, a command3 beluas, E.
behest, which, though it is to be kept apart from A. S. halan,
Goth. haitan, D. heeten, etc„ yet coincides with it in meaning.
Thus a supposed anthdsi would virtually agree with Goth. anda-
hait, acknowledgment; an adjective antluisia may be ‘⁶ (a fec)
given in acknowledgment.” The anthdu‘ (and-hess) accordingly
would be, what may be called, a recognizance, i. e. a fee of recog-

mzlanngiint of fact the achasius, adhesius amounts to the same as the

Ο. Fris. muudsket, i. e. the fee to be paid in acknowledgrnent of the
mund, or protection afforded by the guardian. Nothing can be
clear-er and more explicit than the passage in the Fris. LL. 429,
4 sqq. : ‘⁴ hit ne se, dat dio frouwe ene oderne man nime, soe aegh
