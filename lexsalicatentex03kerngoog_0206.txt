pass into on, un because the notion expressed by the latter in some
compounds, viz. that of “against nature, monstrous‚” does not
perceptibly differ from and, against law or duez e. g. in D. on-
mem-cla, a monster, misci-canu cf. Ο. N. ananeli, monstrosityg
D. ondier, a monster: andana, a misdeed. A Frankish unmig,
unseemly, abominable, occurs Gl. L. 97 53 the u is the Umlaut of
uo (ὃ), unless the true reading be untamig, M. D. ommelik, inde·
cent, improper. Iu short, andtorm'tha is informality, an unlawsul
doing, or, as the Latin puts it, doing “supra legem aut debitum,”
or (as in Tit. LXXVIII, ᾇ 7) “ contra legem et iustitiam.”

LII.

ᾗ 242. Necthanteo (read methuma-0> is some case, probably the
dative, of a fem. stem necthanthia, properlya pres. part. used as an
abstract noun, like Ο. Η. G. kebandt, gratia (see Grafl', Spr. IV, 11 1
and cf. Grimm, D. G. 11, 342), wanti, materia, substantia, man·
sio; eoves-anti, essentia; Ο. N. hvessandi, recital; the same forma·
tions are very common in Latin, e. g. observantia, diligentia, and
the like, The ntl· instead os nd is, as we have seen before, the
usual ending os the partic. iu Salic and the Saxon of the Gl. Prud.
The verb necthan, i.e. nechtan, for an older ηαεΙιέὶδη, is a derivative
from nechti, M. D. nechte, κοιλία (also ghenaclzte, glemu-late) “ con-
stitutum, dies adius experiendum condictus et constitutus ”3 ghe-
nachte ten m‘em'en dagen is “ actio iuridica post decimam quartam
noctem '’ (cs. Kil. i. v. ghenachte). It is clear that necati, παι-Μ’ is
properly nothing but what we call ‘⁸ a term of time‚” while the
verb nachtz'dn, nechtan not only means “ giving a term for so and so
many nights (i. e. days),” but also ‘⁴ to give an adjournment.''
Nechtantheo, necletanffio may be rendered: ‘⁸ for the adjournment,''
which is attended with extra expenses. For ante-salina in 6 1 pro-
pose to read antstalina, the supplying, giving a supplement; cf.
Goth. andstald, ἐπιχορηγίας andstaldan, ἐπιχορηγεῖν, παρέχειν.
Nechtantheo anat-taliam would be “a supplying, an extra payment
for the adjournment.”

Tauthe in ιο agrees with the Malb. in 6-9, except that the first
syllable is wanting. Ι believe we may confidently read nehtaathe.

LIV.

ᾖ 243. Obgrafio (in ᾗ 2 oscod. ι) is, apparently, compounded of
grafio and ob, Goth. us, under. Such a word would be the coun-
terpart of D. ondergmafi viscount‚ under-sheriff. There is one
circumstance which makes this explanation doubtful: namely,
cod. 1 is so addicted to coclmeyism that we must assume the
possibility of hobgraflo‚ i. e. hosgmfio being intended; this would
be literally “ comes palatii,” or “ comes palatinus.”

ᾖ 244. Leodo samz'tem in 2 cannot be separated from leude sacce-
muther which is found in the nat paragraph. Leodo is a misread
leode = leude, the weregild. For samz‘tem ε·- saccmuther 1 guess
that we must read sacm'ten = sacceuut'ten or even saccewuten, sor
ωτι instead os wi is frequent enough3 e. g. A. S. πειτα τοίως
Germ. wusste for miste, etc. It matters little whether we identify
succe with 0. S. saka, O. H. G. sacha, Ο. N. sb‘k, 0. F ris. sake, or
with Ο. Η. G. sec-chia, ,ια-σε, Ο. Fris. sake, seike, sor both mean the
same, namely: causa, lis, crimen, culpa, and also penalty, verdict,
mulct, as appears from O. N. sekr, sentenced, condemned, out·
lawed 3 seht, seb), a penalty, fine, mulct. Witen looks like a gen.
(governed by leode.) of πίω, a knower, one who takes cognizauce‚
A. S. wita, consiliarius, senator. If we prefer reading saccem'tres,
the result will be the same, 'as Ο. N. vitr means “ wise,” and vim,

5⁴¹

to manifest, reveal. In fact the knover and the reportet is one aad
the same person. Consequently, the sacwito or saccemltr is, linguis·
tie-ny speaking, he who takes cognizance os the crime and the
pronouncer os the verdict or penalty.

How sar the saccem'to, -sm'tr differs stom a common meccham is
obscure ; at any rate the Malb. of ᾇ 1 seems to be misplaced, sor the
name for a count is of course gmfio. In the absence of collateral
evidence ve must satisfy ourselves with the guess that saccem‘so,
-m’tr, which was originally synonymous with saccetum, was occa·
sionally and conventionally applied to a particular officer belonging
to the class of saccebaroe, a saccebam “ qui puer regius fuit,'’ or an

Sacebam in ι, sacebom in 2, and the other various readings, may
be reduced to two classes, the one marked by saci and its legitimate
variations, the other by sag-i. A comparison of the readings in their
mutual relation yields as result that saci, sace is rather O. Η. G.
secobia than sacha. Is it were otherwise, then some form like saca
would not, it might be expected, be wholly wanting. We have
seen above that this question is of slight importanee as regards the
meaning of the word. Sagi, in 7 and 9sags (¹), is Ο. Fris. sege,
enunciation, indictment; e. g. Fris. LL. 418, 1, sqq. τ “ Dat is riucht
dat di schelta dem sega monia schil, ende als dio sege ginsen is·-
so aeg di schelta dine aesga to bannene u· ene riuchta dome.” In a
certain aspect the opposite is Ο. Η. G. antsegia, excusatio; cs.
Richth. Gloss. i. v. sege (ἵ). Between saci (succe, sacia) and sagi
the points of contact are so numerous that we cannot be astonished
to see some codd: having the former, others the latter form.

Bam and horo are well-known alternating forms os the nom.
agentis bero from ber-an, to bear3 e. g. Ο. Fris. walaham, -ὸηα,
but M. S. ”albor-m M. D. and N. D. mombaar, momboor, Ο. S.
mundbom. Borro stands sor bory'o, from borjczn, D. heum, O. N.
byry‘a, suscipere, etc.; bam sor barjo, from barsan, to indict.
accuse, deliver. Now, the Ο. N. bera is the standing term in the
Grfigas sor the delivery of a verdict by a jury, and thus we obtain
the provisional result that baro, horo, barro, bor-m all practically
amount to the same, and convey the notion which the English to
bear shows in the phrase to bear manes& cf. 011. Dict. i. v. bem.

Sacibaro, sacebam, sacchore», nearly = Ο. N. saber-abed, a plain·
tiff, accuser; properly he who brings forward a suit, it may also
mean he who delivers the verdict; sagzbam, sag-ibam, he who
delivers the indictment. Or is sag-i be taken in the conventiones
sense which its synonym km‘ffr has in Ο. N. law, a sag-tzar» will be
a person to whom belongs the kvfflburur, the verdict or delivery
of the verdict of jurors. Even burb'r is radically akin to baro,
In giving a lingnistic analysis, it is well not to pretend to be able
to determine the idiomatic application of a term, sor its elemeuts
often show so many shades of meaning that a large margin will be
left for doubt. We cannot make out what were the functions os
the sacebaro in a given period without having other data at our dis-
posal. Unfortunately we learn very little about him from the Lex,
and vvhat we do hear of him is conveyed in a couple os phrases
which in the greater number of the codices have been sadly disfigured.
Under these circumstances it would be easy to find anything we

(¹) 'rho s is not nnlikely a misready (ὓς yet it is not impossible that there
was a word like M. D. segsman, arbiter, diuoepmor. As to the form of the
gen. sags, cf. 0. S. wemldes.
