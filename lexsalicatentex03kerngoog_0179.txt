NOTES. TITT. XX. XXI. XXII.

mino, the latter having gone astray into the next Title. In 2 we
find (cha ?)min, chamini, and chamino ,· in 6 chamna and chamin ;
in 10 chanani, (thamnam, chamnin, read chamna. Chamim'a is the
nom. action. belonging to a supposed verb chamicm, chammian,
O. Fris. hamma, hemma, to pinch; e. g. Fris. LL. 333, 12:
“jeved (i. e. lith) ehemmed is jestha lemed is,'’ i. e. isit (the limb)
is pinched (squeezed) or lamed ; and 220, 21 : “tha endelesta lithe
hammeth jeftha lammeth.’'

Slightly different is the term in 7, 9, to wit, chr-ar? (read
chr-amn), chranum, dammim), erami (read cramin or chramin),
chranm's (read chramni), chrannes (read chmmne). The corre-
sponding verb hramian, hrammian, is Ο. Ν. hremma, to clutch‚
whence hrammr, a paw. It stands to Germ. krammen, to clutch,
,1ο wound by squeezing (cs. Hildebrand in D. Wrtb. i. v.), Danish
kramme, etc„ in the same relation as A. S. clemman, O. S. clem·
mm, M. D. and N. D. klemmen to Goth. hlamma. It is just
possible that the corrupt erarm' in 9, and, consequently‚ chrami in
7, fully represents cramin, for in these MSS. the c is now and then
expressed by ch ; cf. chr-uda or churda for cruda in Tit. V.

Milt'charde in 6, malichardi, ..cardi in 7, 9, mane charde in 10 is
311 incorrect combination of two termS. The former dissyllable
points to in elli, in ali, in alne, i. e. “in the elbow ”3 cf. Goth.
aleina, Ο. H. G. elina, elin, elne, elle, Ο. N. alin, ὄίη, etc„ cubitus,
Char-de, charde is O. H. G. har-ti, scapula; O. N. plur. herdar, the
shoulderS. In ali (alne, ella) ought to come in the second ᾗ. The
original may have run thus: aramis (al. alne, elli, alim) chamin ;
chureii-chamin. Alnc, etc„ would show the stem, as forming part
of a compound; the same applies to charde and clrardi, though this
last word might also be a genitive sing.

ἦ 119. Most interesting is the word for breast, namely‚ bruct (1. e.
brucht) in 6, bract (i. e. bracht) in 7, 9, brach, read brath in 10.
The e in ὂντα-ιε, bruthe, as well as the i in bracti, are the signs os
the dative. Brucht, etc„ stands to O. S. briost, O. H. G. brust,
A. S. breost, etc„ in pretty much the same relation as e. g. Ο. Η. G.
kumst (presupposing an older kum(p)t)‚ N. H. G. kunst, to M. D.
and N. D. hom-st, and is exactly analogous to M. D. and N. D.
(gemacht, compared with E. wnkt ‚· O. N. rist, the instep, answers
to D. wreef, dialect. wreeg, wncg ,· Ο. Fris. wnkt, wirst; A. 8.
ωηὶςτ, carpus. Wnlrt stands according to rule for wn'hst, and is a
derivative from the same root as the verb A. S. wringan, E. to
wring, D. wrangon, and Skr. wrhati, to wring, pull, snatch (¹). In
the same manner brust, i. e. bruhst and bruht, owe their origin to
a verb which in Skr. appears in the form of bruhati, to swell;
whence brhat, swelling, high, big; bfnhayati, to cause to wax, to
render big, etc. To strengthen this etymological explanation I
refer to the Skr. wakshas, the breast, which belongs, apparently at
least, to the family of the verb wakshati, to wax, and to uras,
meaning also breast, allied to ura, extensive, broad3 in all these
words the notion of swelling, extending, extending one's sels,

covering, protecting, are contained at the same time. An almost '

convincing proof that bruht, brust, is really derived from brnhati is
the fact that in O. N. we have, by the side os bry'dst, the form
bringa, the breast, Swed. bringa, Dan. bringe.

As to the variation between the vowels u and a in brucht, bruth,
and bracht, we meet with the same phenomenon in O. Fris„ in
which brust and brast are equally common, along with sundry
other forms nearly allied to those in Ο. 8., A. S., and O. N.. viz.,

(²) The so-called root warh has nothing whatever to do with harh.

bran-t, and to the Dutch horst, viz„ burst, horst. As to the dialec-
tical th in 10 instead of ht (cht), cs. the remarks on druthe in
Tit. XIII. Cf. ,also Ο. Η. G. widharbruhtic, rebellis, widerbmstic
with D. wederbarstzg.

For ite? (dem) bracti in 7, 9, we have to read bi them bracii, by
the breast ; in 10 bi dem bruthe. Bi them or dem answers to Ο. S.
bi them.

ᾗ 120. Flemere in 10, fimere and femere in 2, etc„ must indicate
the name of some kind of vessel, because the same Malb. stands in
ἦ 1 and 2, though in the former § there is question of transire, in
the latter of furare. Considering that a Frankish w has often
been mistaken by the scribes sor an m, 1 think that the word
intended is flewere, flewire‚ fliwere, fliwire, which is essentially
the O. N. stay (¹), flqskip, D. vlz'eboot, E. flyboat. The per-
sonal ending ere, ire, very frequently enterS, as we know, into
the names of various kinds of ships, because ships as well as
weapons are so to say treated as if they were living beings. In
English we have such words as schooncr, «legger, luggcr, steamer ,-
in Dutch there are perhaps a dozen of them, as eiker (Ο. Ν.
eikja), a small serry-boam doggcr, schoener, loggcr, driedekker‚
driemaster, lichter, stoomer, etc. Instances of even more dis-
tinct personification are the E. man-os-war and D. bear-tman, a
packet·boat. For the Frankish ending ere, Goth. areis, cf. helpere,
Ps. 58, 18; hulpere‚ 61, 75 antfengere, 58, 11, etc.; ire is at least
explicable3 cf. the Saxon iri in biscermin', Gl. Prud. 76.

ἑ 121. The Latinized arcus shows that the Frank5, in common
with the Norsemen and other Teutons, had the word which in O. N.
sounds askr, a small vessel, a bark; A. S. oesc, dromo ; whence oesc-
man, 0. N. askmaffr, and the would-be Latin Ascomanni. When
we consider that the Malb. decidedly shows asco, which may be the
dative or the accusative (²), and observe the dative plur. askim in
the O.H. G. Hildebrand fragment and the D. 'form esch, an ash
tree, N. H. G. esche, we must conclude that the word was a stem
in u, which afterwards passed into the i clasS. ,

ChangiascO, chaugasco, changascho—these are the readings in-
tended—is a compound os asc, asch and chang-i, Ο. N. herig-i,
hanging. Chang-iasc, and with elision of i, change-sc, is rendered
in Latin by “ ascum in suspensum positum ’'; the dative in Frank·
ish is,· probably, governed by the verb “to steal.”

The isolated fectho in 1 is a riddle which 1 have no means of
solving.

§ 122. As untedio, anthedio, etc., indicates a fine of 1800d., it
does not tally 111 the first ξ with the fine there specified. There
must be somehow an error in the paragraph. The gloss not
unlikely belongs to the preceding Tit1e; at least, the required
untedio has been omitted there in the last § and the last but
one.

Urbis malatina—thus read in 6—10—is here rendered by: ‘⁶ si-
quis sclusam de farinario ruperit ”; in Tit. XXXI (cod. 6) by:
“ si quis mulierem—de via sua obstaverit aut i1npinxerit.” Both
translations decisively prove that there is no question of waylaying,

(² ) It need not be remarked that stey, as it is etymologicauy identical with
Gr. πλοῖον, must originally have denoted a vessel, a boat in general.

(²) More probably the former, because aster the analogy of Ο. S. and A. S.
we might expect in the accus. asc, the syllable being along one.
