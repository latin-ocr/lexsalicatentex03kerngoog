For the Malberg in this Title 1 refer to the discussion in Μ 95,
97, 99, 101. The notion of “innocence ” attaching to seolaas used
ilpossg {mk Law is clearly indicated by the Latin words “ innocens

§ 116. In toucrbus os 2, tboouerpo of 7, 9 we easily recognise D.
tooven Ο. H. G. soubar, incantatio, maleficium, veneficium (s.
Graff, Spr. V, 580). T rouuer in 6 should be touver (¹), a dialectic
variety of toover, agreeing as to the vowel with toufere, veneficuS,
in the Frank. Ps. 57, 6. The th in 7, 9, 10 is another instance of
a bad but frequent spelling, just as in E. names. Quovirgo in 7
is an instructive instance of text corruption. Already the common
parent os 7, 8, 9 had couirgO, or at any rate such a t as could be
mistaken ’sor c by all subsequent copyists. The change of co to
quo is due to both co and quo being pronounced alike in the semi-
Latin period. The temptation to express the sound heard as ko by
quo was an the greater because quo virgo has such a nice Latin
look about it. Errors of this kind go far to prove that the scribes
were entirely ignorant of Frankish.

The variations in the latterpart os the term arenot readily accounted
for. How shall we reconcile bus with io in 4, po in 6, go and po in
7, 9, pho, fo in ιο ? 1 guess that the word intended is gibus, giso
(gipho), the remnants of which are scattered in the MSS. Gibus
is the gen„ giso the gen. or dat. c. of a fem. stem giba, gisa, O. S.
giba, ἔργα, geba, Goth. giba, Ο. Η. G. geba, giba, A. S. gysa, geofu,
etc., donum. Tovergiba, toovergifa, exactly answers to the syno-
nymous O. H. G. eittargheba, veneficium (s. Graff, Spr. 1v, 122),
and from the Ο. H. 6., M. H. 6., N. H. 6., and D. word gift,
poison, as well as from D. vergeven and vaga-'fugem Ο. Η. G. fer·
gistjan, etc., it is clear that the most common term for poisoningin
the languages next akin to that os the Salic Franks must have been
the very word goe'van.

Tovergiba may as well be rendered by “maleficium ’' as by
“ veneficium ” 3 hence text 2 uses “ maleficia facere aut dare bibere.'’
A somewhat more limited sense may have been attached to the
words “ herbas dare bibere,'’ as cod. 1 puts it. The Malberg want-
ing in the first § has, by some oversight, 1 fancy, passed into
the next. For urtz‘ of umfugiam answers so exactly to the Frank.
uurt, uwurt (stem wurti), herba, in 61. L. 1032 and 1068, A. S.
mrt, Ο. 8. uurt, hettaruurt, etc., that we can hardly suppose the
coincidence to be an accidental one (2). For fugiam, which in its
way is as quaint a would-be Latinisation as quo virgo, 1 propose to
read fulgiu or fulgin, both genitives osa supposed fulgia, being the
nom. action. offulgian, A. S. Jssgian, to persecute, Ο. S. sagon,
to inflict (injur-ies). It matters little whether we take fulgianin the
sense of persecuting, as e. g. in Cynewulf's Crist, 1440: “fylgdon
me mid sirenum, faehve ne rohtun, and mid sweopum slagunss’ or in

(²) It is not absolutely impossible that here and there the word was pro-
nounced trouver, with a surreptitious r, as in French tre'sor, Ο. S. {resur and
tresu in tre-mrbus, 0.H.G. tres-o, D. mes [kamerL A. S. {rm-or,- the Ο.
Frank. of the Psalms has tmkewer, 61. L. 9573 the O.S. of the 61. Prud.
576, traso-has. An analogous troover is possible, but at the same time it

would be an unoriginal form.
ς’) It will be noticed that both here and in i 9 ot Tit. XVII the text has

“ evaserit.” Far from supposing that urisfugxh in XIX also might be an altered
untflugv'a, 1 think that the superficial similarity between both glosses has
contributed to the corruption of the former gloss, not the reverse.

that of inflicting, casting upon, as in Heliand 161, 16, “ folgodun im
firinword, thar hie an feteron geng,” i. e. “ afficiebant eum blasphe-
miis 3 ” in either case urtzfulgzh or uurt is capable of being ren-
dered by ‘⁴ a giving, administer-ing, of poisonous herbs,” i. e. “ herbas
dare bibere.”

The proposed insertion of the l may be justified by an appeal to
the Malb. acfaltho, read atfaltho in ιο, where the letter really
makes its appearance twice over. Faltho, i. e. salhtlw = salgdo, is

not identical with fhlgia ; it is derived from another verb and with ·

another suffix, but from the same root, aud it can be proved from
the use offelgian (sorsalgian) in the Heliand, that falgiau (salht‘an)
and solgon were synonymous. Forin that poem (151, 19) we read:
“ thar im Oc en wlf bigan felgian firinspraka.” Τ1ιο corresponding
verbs in A. S. oetfylejgan and aetfelgun, both meaning “ adhaerere ’‘
(cf. Grein‚ 61. i. vv.), are likewise synonymous. The strong verb
oegfeolan also shows essentially the same significations of “ tradere ’³
and ‘⁴ adhaerere, insistere.” The same applies to the A. S. besco-
lan‚ bifeolan, immittere, infigere, tradere, O.S. bifelkan, and A. S.
bqselgan, sz'elgan.

After reconstruction the Malb. in 10 will read thus: thouvergwfo
atsaltho ,· in 7 [8]‚ 9, thoovergipho alfaldo, two substantives which
may be rendered by the phrase “ si veneficio (or maleficio) affectus
fuerit.” Whether gaso represents the instrum. or the genit. c. can·
not be discerned3 both are admissible.

ᾇ 1 1 7. Closely allied to A. S. befeolan, tradere, infigere, is bqfaestan
(ε. Grein‚ 61. i. vv.), whilst oetsaertan entirely coincides with O. S.

felgi'an and folgon ,· cf. such expressions as ece edwit oetfoestan

(Ps. 77, 66), and Ο. S. firinspbdkafelgian. It seems to me that
the Malb. affectu leudi in 10 points to an original reading atfartu
leudi. Atfestu would be the genit. c. of atsesta, the nom. action.
of a supposed atsestan (sor atsastz'an), avariation of A. S. oetfaestan.
The appropriateness of such a word is sh'own by expressions like
tednan, lad, oetfaestan (cf. Grein‚ 61. i. v.). An indirect confirma·
tion of the presumption that affectu is to be corrected into atses-tu
or, perhaps, atsestii, is the fact that in the latest MS. only
we find a § running thus: “ Si quis alteri aliquod maleficium
superjactaverit sive cum ligaturis· in aliquo loco miserit.'' What
can have given n’se to this addition Ρ No doubt, the very word
affesta, which occurred in some sources, but, most likely, only as
a synonym of affaltho, affalgdo. As however atsestian properly
means “ to fix upon, bind upon,'’ some reviset took it in the sense
of fastening or fastening upon (impingere), and thought it necessary
to add a new ἑ, in which he put his interpretation os atses-ta or
atfesti in the cautiously chosen words ε “ maleficium super-iactaverit
(i. e. impegerit) sive cum ligaturis miserit.'’

As regards the gloss in θ 2 of 2 and 4, 1 can only remark that it
is an erroneous repetition os the Malb. in the preceding Title,
owing to the amount of the fine in both places being equal. No
wonder that there is nothing like it in the other codices,

variations 3 the stem is chaminid, answering to such Goth. words as
larheim. The ending in, im‘, ni belongs to the nominative 3 ino, no
to the genit. or dat. case (¹). Cod. 1 shows both chamin and cham-
