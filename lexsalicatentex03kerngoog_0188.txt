NOTES. TIT. XXIX.

(read sent) fior pond ς jef thi thama al offe is, soe send (read seut)

sex pund. Jes thi scotfinger al offe is itta knocla, soe send (sent) ,

fior pund ; jes hi al offe is, soe ist sextehal pund3 sulke boka hal-
deth fijf pund.” It is clear that the Frisian law distinguishes
between ‘⁶ off at the knuckle” and “all off.” The latter is ex-
pressed in the Salic Law by “pollicem (ort secundum digitum)
excusserit‚” the former by “pollex mancatusss’

Alae ham in 1, alachtam (read alat cham) in 10, athletam (read
allatclzam) in 6, contains alat, allat, Ο. Η. G. allaz, M. D. allet,
alet, totum. Ham, cham is Ο. H. G. hamm, cripple, in Otfrid 3,
4, 8: “ Then bifiangun umbi porzicha finfi, thie lagun sol al man-
nes siaches inti hammes-3⁹ It may also be a substantive; indeed,
hamo in 2 looks like the genit. or dat. of a femin. hama, but if it be
intended as such, the form alat is not admissible; a compound ala-
cham would not be objectionable, cf. Ο. S. alajung, alahe‘l, ala-
mahtig, alahwit. It must be observed that the readings alachtam
and alacktamo' in 10, though slightly corrupt, decidedly prevent us
from taking the word as a compound. For ablatam in 6 read allat
ham. That the term is added in § 3 of 2, ἦ 5 of 6, and the latter
part of ᾗ 3 of 10, is a mistake, as only chaminis is required. Wrong
also is the addition os biorotro in 6, briorodero in 10, bn'oro in 7· 9.
The words meant are ‘orioro thero (¹) (Uero) and &rior-0, O. H. G.
driero derv, Ο. Fris· thrira them, trium eorum (scil. digitorum).
Drioro is simply “ trium,” unless we suppose that 7—9 intended
'Urio iro, tria (or trium) eorum. The genit. must have been
governed by a word denoting entire mutilation, consequently not
chamini-c. Dn‘oro thero should be transferred to ξ 7 (os 6); it
answers to ‘⁴ sequentes digitos„ id est tres.” Os 7-9 the text itself
has suffered mutilation, the case stated in §6 of 1, etc„ being
wanting. From the Malb. bn'oro (read drioro) in 7-9, we may
gather that their source must have contained something to the
same effect as the other codd., but that it had already mixed up two
paragraphs. .

ξ 161. The middle finger is called daphanu in 6, tephano, rep-
phano in 10, thaplumo in 7, 9, taphano in 8. The corrected read-
ing is darphanm tharphano, therpltarw, an accus. masc. os an adjec-
tive darfi, confounded with tharfi, ther-fi, O. Fris. der-ve ει ther-ve,
rough, coarse, blunt; then-a dusslech, Fris. LL. 454, 23, but den-e
dusslech 445, 23. Darfi agrees with Ο. S. derbi, der-cri, improbuS,
audax; Ο. N. djarfr, bold, impudent3 Ο. Fris. der-ve, whereas
tbarfi, therfi is the counterpart of O. Ν. pyhrgfr, unleavened, vile,
thitfingr, a wretch (s. Jonss. Oldn. Ordb. i. v.); N. H. G. derb.
It is beyond the scope of this work to treat os the confusion
between d and th in these words, as in Ο. S. thur-ban and durban
(cf. Schmeller’s Gloss. on the Heliand i. v.). Suffice it to say that
we meet with the same phenomenon in the Frank. term. Both
tbarfi and (1αηῖ allow us to suppose thatpopular etymology under-
stood it in the sense of “digitus impudicus‚” but also of “the
rough, big finger,'’ agreeing with the F risian tha· Iangesta, langa or
gnita finger. The real etymology, i. e. the sense attached to tharfi
or darfi fingr by him who first used the word was, os course, as
unknown to the Franks as to us. The accus. case of the Malb.
agrees with “medianum ’⁹ of the Latin text.

ξ 162. Likewise an accusat. is ‘⁴ quartum digitum ” and the cor-
responding Frank. word, which we should read : welachano,
welagno, audegane, welecltano. Wlag, welach, welech is O. H. G.
welag, welac, walae, A. S. welig, fich3 D. weltg, luxuriant; cf.
O. S. welo, richer», opulence. The ‘⁶ rich finger'' is synonymous

with the usual O. Fris. and A. S. term, viz. goldfinger, pre-
served in N. H. G., along with the more common ringfinger‚ 0. N.
baugfingr. The origin of one of the names of the goldfmger in
M. D., viz. hertm‘nger, is unknown to me; Ι guess that it is a dial.
pronunciation of hort-m'nger‚ literally “ heard-finger,'’ i. e. gold-
finger.

ᾗ 163. The little finger is called mineclin, a substantive in the
form os a diminutive, exactly like O. S. nessiklin, a small worm,
from nea-so, a worm (Heyne, Kl. D. 91). Mine is coordinate with
Goth. mim, A. S. and D. min, smaller, very small. The final o in
mineclino is a phonetical addition. The readings in 7-10 are
hardly correct3 mene sor mine is scarcely better Frankish than
mem'mus, as 9 writes, is Latin ; both were altered under the
influence of the Romanic pronunciation os the scribe.

§ 164. Chalde, chalda in 10 answers to ‘⁶ teneat ”3 childe in 6, if
correct, to “tenuerit.” In other words cbalde, chalda is the 3rd
pers. sing. pres. subj. of haldan, tenere, = A. S. hedde, Ο. S.
balde, halda‚· childe would be Ο. S. hetdi, M. D. hilde, hielde.
The u in chalde, chalda causes some trouble; to change it into a
would not be sase, notwithstanding a and u are regularly confused.
It is just possible that chuzae is a less accurate spelling sor cholda,
and that the more ancient ald had already begun to pass into pla,
This much is certain' that ota in its tum had become obsolete in the
standard M. D. before Α. D. 1200.

Chim, clina is an altered thena or telana, ‘⁶ of the tooess’ from
tab), A. S. talu, td, Ο. N. td, Ο. H. G. seha, D. tce and teen.
Chamina is the accuS. of chamin, the laming, hurting; sartae (read
uite), sublate the same case of steht, complete mutilationi. Chalae
mma chamina, literally translated, would be: ‘⁶ (sic ut) teneat
digitorum pedis debilitatem ”3 chalde telina sichte, ‘⁴ teneat digi-
torum pedis mutilationem.” The Malb. chdna chlom (in note to
ξ 11 of Cod. 10) is an anticipation of ᾖ 14.

§ 165. Luchauina in 7, libanino in 9, Iiahahauma in 8, incha-
bina in 6, liclamina in 10, is a compound the latter part of which
is luivina = Mbma, the nom. action. of haman, Ο. S. havian, in
the partic. gihdvid‚ mancus, Gl. Prud. 166; arens (manus) 592;
gihdvz‘dltkm mancum 608. The verb is derived from the adjective
Ο. S. luis, Ιιάδ, crippled, Goth. hanss, aruntis. Ο. H. G. hauns.
On comparing the various readings we arrive at the conclusion that
liuha is a mistake' for liaht ,· luc for lact, i. e. luch! ‚· lic sor lice,
i. e. lickt ,· all well-known developments of Goth. liuhap, light
(here eyelight, eye); Ο. S. la'oht, leoht, lialct ; Ο. H. G. lioht,
leoht, lieht, lilzt ; O. Fris. liacht, licht, h'ucht ; M. D. lucht, licht.
The approximately correct reading of the term deuoting ‘⁸ oculi de-
bilitatio” will be luctham'na, licthavina, liahthavina, liuct- (or lact)
laabim, licthwma. cf. also ξ 169 below.

§ 166. Frasito in 6, fmsitto in 10 means fraslito, fraslitto, from

fraslitan, Ο. S. sarslitan, Ο. H. G. sarslisan, fer-sliam, abscindere,

discindere; fra shows the old Goth. form. The gender, case, and
formation os the word are not clear, though it may be supposed that
fraslitto is the more accurate spelling, and the genit. or dat. of a
femin. fmslz‘tta, contracted from fraslititha ; cf. O. H. G. stklzlu'da,
discidium (Graff, Spr. VI, 819).

ᾗ 167. As gloss to “ auriculam excusserit,” we find chunnideum
in 10, to which we must add the erratic chdnachlom os ᾗ 11; 6 has
chanodeora ; 7, 9 sunneckleura ,· 8 Ῑτιηεᾱειινα (οι- cleura). The
latter part of this compound is meant to be cleosa, cleusa (awk-
wardly spelt emensa), the cleaving, which is a femin. subst. belong-
ing to the verb cleosan, cleusan, A. S. cledsan‚ O. N. kh’ujfa, O. S.
kliobtm, D. himen, to cleave. The corresponding term in Ο. Fris.
