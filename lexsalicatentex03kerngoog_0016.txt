INTRODUCTION.

series, a number of 89 chapters, but the first 65 terminate with the
chapter: De caballo δια, and the remainder seem to be later
additions. Again, in cod. 2 the number of chapters from De man-
nire, to De caballo &c., or Lex I as the cod. has it (see titt. 65 and
99), is actually 68, but the 46th and 47th are mere repetitions of
chapters 66 and 65, and chap. 58 : De dispeccr'om'bus, is in none of
the other textS‚ except in Herold’s edition, where it is combined
with tit. 59. In cod. 3 the number of Capitula legis Salia-ae is 84
as given in the table of rubricS, and apparently 83 in the text, which
seems to be defective at the end. But the chapters 66-80 con-
tain a text of the Pactum pro tenore pacis· (forming the chapters
78-91 in cod. 2), and the chapters 81, 82, and 83 are a corrupt copy
of the 78th, 42nd‚ and 7 5th chapters of the Lex Burgundionum.

Therefore, codd. 1—3 have in reality a text of 65 chapters, just
as codd. 4, 5 and 6.

It may be presumed that allusion is made to these 65 chapters in
the Recapitulatio Legis Salicae (see col. 425), where it is said:
‘⁶ Sciendum est quod in quibusdam legis (libellis) Salicis inueniun-
tur capitula principalia LXV.” On the authority of the Epilogues
this first portion (namely, the Latin version os it) may be ascribed
to Chlovis. In any case it may be assumed that the text of codd.
1-4 is anterior to all the others and dates froin a time when Chris·
tianity had not yet become general among the Franks. Codd. 1-4
do not contain any of the enactments against those who murder
priestS‚ pillage or burn chnrches (cf. tit. 55), nor the clause prohi-
biting marriages between near relatives (cf. tit. 13) which, with
regard to the Franks, were first forbidden by an edict of King
Childebert, ΑΛ). 596 (see Monum. Germ. Legg. 1. p. 9). Nor do
these codd. say of Chrenecruda (cf. tit. 58) that it was a pagan cus·
tom (also abolished by the same edict of 596, cap. 5). Moreover, the
Leiden cod„ which contains a text almost literally the same, in the
first 71 chapters (except ch. 2), as the text adopted by Charlemagne,
says in the second chapter (see ch. 102 of the present work): “Non
est sacramentum in Francos; quando illi legem composuerunt, non
erant 011131121ιί.υ Waitz (Das alte Recht der Sal. Franken‚ p, 5
sqq.) points out other characteristica of codd. 1-4‚ which do not
occur in the later codd. and seem to claim for the former a greater
originality than for the other families.

lished it as his third text, with the various readings of 5. It is
Merkel's sixth text, and has in the present work also been called
cod. 6, and made the basis of the text in the 5th column. Cf. Par-
dessus, Pref. XXXI.

Both these MSS. contain a text in 65 chapterS, with the so-called
Glosses like the MSS. of the First Family, but with ⁹interpolations
or numerous additions which point to a later period. In the first

XIV. Again, ch. LVIII: De expoliatione eccleseioe vel r’ncendio sive ho-
micidiis clem-orum, is not represented in the oldest redactions, made at a
time when the Franks had not yet embraced Christianity (the first l occurs in
texts 5 and 6, but aa {7 of ch. 55, = ch. 57 of the Lex Eun). On the other
hand the older texts have a separate chapter XV, which, in the Lex Emend„
is combined with ch. XIV.

place, ch. 13 : De raptu mulierum contains a paragraph (11) pro·
nouncing fines on marriages between near relatives. The textos
this paragraph is a copy of the interpretation of Alaric’s Breviary on
the 3rd constitution of the Cod. Theod. 111. 12, and could have been
inserted in a text of the Salic Law only after A. 1). 506. Μοτοονετ,
Pardessus (Loi Sal. p. 35) remarks that, if the Salio Law had, from
the beginning, contained this enactment, the Edict which Bouquet
ascribes to Childebert Ι. an. 532, others to Childebert 11. an. 596,
and by which such marriages are prohibited, would not have been
necessarm neither would the Councils of Orleans (511), Albon

have confined themselves to prohibiting them in the name of religion
and pronouncing canoniea! punishments. They would evidently
have invoked the civil law isit had existed. W'hether the paragraphs
6 and 7 of tit. 55 relate to Christianity is doubted by Kern (ᾗ 253).

The similarity of the text presented by codd. 5 and 6 to the lex
Emendata is evident on a mere comparison of the two texts.

It would appear that a text, which seems to be lost, served as the
basis of this one and the codd. of the third Family. Sohm (R. u.
Ger. Verf. p. 41) and Waitz (A. R. p. 7) discuss this point at
length. That the arrangement of the text of the Third F amily,
or, let us say, its mactments were known to the compilet or com-
pilers of cod. 6 is evident from the table of rubrics in this cod„
where we find between the rubn'cs of titt. 47 and 48, the annum-
bered rubric: De homine de barca abatuto. Under tit. 41 it will
be seen that this tit. occurs neither in cod. 6, nor in 5, and it is
further to be observed that cod. 1 puts it ina different place, not to
speak of the arrangement adopted in the other texts.
