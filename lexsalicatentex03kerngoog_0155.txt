centuries to the mistakes of copyists in the reading of majuscule
letters. It is during this lapse of time that so many C’s and G's
became confused.

ἑὸ. The character and condition of the glosses and Latinized
words in the Lex Salica are not such as to iumish us with more
than a general outline of the phonetics and grammar of the
langnage. Broadly stated, its features differ but slightly from that
of Old Saxon, though in many respects it looks more archaic, as
might be expected. Down to the present day the new Saxon
“ dialects of North Germany and the eastern part of the Netherlands
beyond the Yssel are closely allied to Frankish Dutch, even to such

an extent that it is difficult to discover discrepancies of any conse· ,

quence and consistency. Everything considered, there is perhaps but
one characteristic deserving to rank as a criterion(¹), namely, the
form of the plural in the present and preterite tenses of the verbs.
Saxon in this respect keeps to Frisian and Old English, whilst
Dutch stands on the same side with High German. Unfortunately
the required data are wanting in the glosses.

Of late years it has become customary, chiefly with German
scholars, to classify Dutch as a Lower Frankish dialect. From an
historical point of view there is nothing against this method. Just
as in the time of Leofwin‚ the English saint whose remains rest in
Deventer, the demarcation was formed by the YsseL so now-a-days
the same river separates the Dutch of the Veluwe from the Saxon
dialect of Salland, Twente and part of the county of Zutphen, the
ancient Hamuland or Chamavia. Whilst admitting the full force
of the arguments derived from the history of the Salian Franks,
I cannot pass over in silence the fact that some glosses in their
peculiarities remind us rather of Frisian than of Saxon or Dutch.
Thus the term for “ way” is consistently written uia (Tit. XXXI),
which shows a greater family likeness to the Ο. Frisian withan to a
Saxon and Dutch wega, wege, weck. On the other hand it cannot be
denied that uia, however consistent, has something suspicions about
it. If it were a genuine Frank word we might expect it to be spelt,
at least for once, with uu (w). This not being the case, it is not
unlikely that the scribeS, with their na‘ive Latinizing tendencieS,
understanding for once the Frank word for “way,” replaced it
by the similar Latin word. Some MSS. of the Lex Emend.‚ in-
cluding cod. 1 1, actually give the Latin genitive viae.

As another Frisian trait in the Frank language we might adduce
the zi for gi, if the reading were not extremely doubtful, as 1 have
already endeavoured to prove. Yet I am not prepared to deny
that the Saliam, in language and still more in law and customS,
had much in common with the F risianS. As they had been
neighbours for some centuries it would be strange if it were other-
wise. The connexion between F rankish and Frisian, as far as
we are able to judge from our scanty data, is exemplified by a word
common to both. A threshold is called in the Lex (Tit. LVIII)
dumpal(us), durpelws), Dutch dorpel, O. Fris. dreppel. Here we
see that the relation between duropal, ὀπηδεῖ, and dorpel, allow-
ance made for the difference in time, is one of identity, between
the same and dreppel one of affinity.

I need not enter here into the vexed question as regards the
relation of the dialects of the Salian Franks to the High- and
Middle-Frankish, briefly also termed Frankish, and its varietieS.
This interesting subject lying beyond the scope of this work, the

certain degree, is one that will become less absolute the farther we go back,

TIT. I.

reader is referred to Prof. K. Miillenhoff's Preface to the and ed.
of his Denknuiler, published by that distinguished scholar in con-
junction with Prof. W. Scherer‚ and further to Prof. Heinzel’s
Gesckicbte der Nrederfriinkzkcken Geschdfarsprache, especially his
introduction. Some of Prof. Mt'illenhoff's conclusions have been
controverted by Dr. W. Braune in an excellent essay in the
Beitrcige (Ι) edited by him in conjunction with Prof. Paul. 1 only
wish to add the remark that, in drawing inferences from the
testimony of ancient writers, we ought to be very cautious. The
same N ithart who gives the well-known Strasburg oaths speaks
of frilingis· lazzibusque(¹) amongst the SaxonS. Now a High
German form lassi is preposterous in Saxon, which can only have
had latii or zati. Hence it is evident that N ithart, unless he were
very ignorant, did not mean to teach his readers the dialectic
peculiar-ities of Saxon, but to inform them of a fact. Consequently
we are not allowed to adduce the peculiar dialect in which Nithart,
Eginhart, etc., clothed some Teutonic word as a proof of anything
but the dialect of the author. Ι

After the foregoing explication of the subject and principles of a
linguistic inquiry into the F rankish elements in the Lex Salica, it

· only behoves me to apologiae to the reader should he find in the

following pages too many discussions, too few established facts.

ξ 7. Of the compound reapte'in cod. 1 Ι take the latter part to be
apten, of which abtena (in cod. 2) is a variation. On pt representing
the sound of ft, cf. ᾗ 5 ; the bt in abtena is a bad spelling forst, asin
Gothic fragr'bts for fruge-'far (St. Luke, i. 27). The so-called gloss
has the appearance of being a nomen αείίοηὶε formed by the fem.
suffix ni, nia, Goth. ns, Ο. Fris. ne, A. S. n(n)‚ O. N. n. The oldest
Frank form of the stem, if indeed it be not the nominative case,
of such words, appears in tkeuloeu'm'a (Tit. LXXXI) and latim‘ae
of codex 1 1(Q) (Tit. XXXI„ much more frequent are the variations
na, no, ne. The distinction between words ending in eins, ons, and
ains, which we find in Goth„ e.g. in naseins, mitons, and lt'har’ns,
is to a certain extent preserved in F rankish‚ e.g. in lanua, musano
(but also rosen), fulchone. A scena, asten, may be a derivative from
a verb of the αι’-01355, and the same as O. Fris. achtene, echtene,
judicial prosecution (cf. Richth. i. v.), from aelata, echtia, echte,
Ο. S. obtima, A. S. eham, to prosecute. The letters ft and ht (che)
are frequently interchanged in all Frankish, Sax. and Fris. dialects;
e.g. druftin for dmlztin (cf. Heyne, Kl. Denkm. p. ¹i13) ; Ο. Fris.
aft, eft, for Dutch echt, genuinuS, legitimus; aftejgi‘a, O. N. ekm, in
matrimonium ducere.

The Fris. achtene, Sax. acbte, Germ. acht, is nearly, if not
entirely, identical in meaning with bonn, barm (cf. Grimm, R. A.
732). In the Fris.. LL. p. 251, we read : “the sitter (i. e. the
defendant) se ladet fon da riuchter, hi cume jef hi cume naet;
kumtter naet and hi uursfime det ryucht so scel die richter him
td bonne duaen.” On comparing this passage with the parallel one
in the Le‘x Salica we are led to suppose that asten means the same
as bann, the more so because the latter is also used to denote

forfeiture; e.g. Fn's. LL. 405: “da ban beta mitta alra hAgista
ban.'’

Much more difficult is the explanation of the syllable re in

(¹) Perta, Monumenta, Scriptt. 11, p.669. In the same volume p. 361 Hucbald
in Vita Lebuini speaks of Saxon lassi. If Hucbald had been a Salian Frank
by birth, he would hardly have failed to recognize the Frankish leti.
