respects. We may render it by ‘⁶ appeal,'’ “the producing of a
warrant ’⁹ ; in origin and form it is almost M. D. betrek, “appella-
tio, provocatio ”3 the verb betrekken means “ appellare, provocare‚”
but ‘⁴ in ius vocare ” at the same time. Firtorht, jeremia very
likely combined both meanings os betrek, and this may be the
reason why the framers of the Latin text were unable to find a
proper Latin equivalent.

ᾖ 230. Adhramire in ‘⁴ ille—debet adhramire ” is here taken in
another sense than in Tit. XXXVII (first section): “ille qui per
vestigium sequitur res suas per tertiam manum debet agramire.”
Etymologically anhramian may perfectly well be explained in both
significations; for the one Ι refer to Note on Tit. XXXV11;
here it signifies “to impute, refer, appcal to another.” We may
safely assume that hrumian, lat-amon, like D. rumen, also meant
‘⁴ putare ”; consequently anhmmian is ‘⁶ imputare.” The corre-
sponding term in A. S. is cennan, gecennan (s, Schmid, Gloss. i. v.
cannati). This may mean either ‘⁸ to make known, declare ” (and
it is interpreted in this sense by Schmid), or “ imputare ” (S.
Grein, Gloss. i. v.). The Latinized A. S. cenninga is entirely
synonymous with tedm. ΤΙιο best commentar-y on adhramire is
Ο. N. henna, as this denotes both “to acknowledge as one’s
own, claim, ” and‘ ‘acknowledgc as another's property, attribute,
impute, bring horne to one.’

ξ 231Sunm', stem sunnia (which occurs already m Tit. Ι, and
which we find here again in sect. 2), means a lawful excuse, impe-
dimentum legitimum, exceptio. The M. D. word is mot-tinne,
Ο. N. naubsyn ,- a derivative is the N. D. verb vernootsinm'gen, ·to
excuse (sig, = oneself) by proving a lawful impediment, in the
municipal law of Zutphen (1) : “ ten ware sake dat hij sig dede ver-
noodtsinnigen, te weten dat hij door lijfsnoodt, water-snoodt oste
heerengebodt verhindert ware geweest.” The Ο. Fris. nedskine‚
nedrkz‘nr'nge, interpreted in a MS. text by nameka, i. e. proof os
necessity, is a curious example of adaptation by so·called popular
etymology; cf. Grimm, R. A. 848 and Richth. Gloss. i. v. ned-
skine. The Ο. S. sunnea in Heliand 70, 13 is simply “ need.”
cf. however Goth. sunja, truth ; sunjon sik, ἅπολογεΐσθαις sunjom,
ἀπολογίας and Lat. sontica causa and insons.

ἦ 2 3²· Gamallus, chamallus is a Latinized gaman, chamall.
Hamallus, arnallus, rhamallus are mere corruptions, It denotes
“ he with whom one has the same sorum ” and “ he with whom

one has a plea.”

§23 3. Calas-tanin in ξ ι of cod. 2 is, apparently, some case of
galis-tama, a nom. action. belonging to a supposed verb galiston.
As lis-t means ‘⁴ doluS, fraus,” galis-tani may be fraudatio. But 1
would rather expect galiugum'o or galuganio, the lying3 cs. O.H.G.
tugindri, falsarius3 D. leugenaar, a liar; or galtbsam'o ,· cf. 0.H.G.
galichesaffl hypocrita; N.H.G. gleisnerg M.D. geli‘yksener. Gulie-
sania would m. m. agree with Ο. Η. G. gelichemng, lichisunga
(cf. Graff, Spr. 11, 119).

ᾇ 234. Widridarchi in ᾇ 2 of cod. 1 obviously signifies ‘⁸ contu-
macy, unwillingness.” 1t is a substantive derived from some adj.
wtdn'clar, in which wt'ciri is the well-known particle widri, weder,

against. Dar is obscure; it may be allied to A. S. deman, D.
deren, nocere; Ο. H. G. tar-bn, nocere, obesse.

9 235. Fer-bannitus, forbannitus is a Latinized serbannid orser-
bannan. It is in substance M. D. gebennen, legitime convocatus,
from bannen (de vierschare), which Kiliaeni. v. renders by· “tri
bunal denuntiare, praetorium cogere, edicere conventum senatorum,
dare senatoribus dicendi iuris auctor-itatem!⁸ The same forbanni-
tus also means “proscriptusss' i. e. banished, ontlawed. This
apparent contradiction is caused by bannan denoting both‘ ‘to
bid’' and‘ ‘to forbid.’' We have an analogous case in Ο. Ν.
kvii5ja, to forbid, banish, but kveb'a, to say, kveoja, to call on,
address, request, summon. From the parallelism in the nse os
hannan and kvessja, kannja, we may infer that originally bannan
denoted in general to say, to speak lond, to speak emphatioelly.
In fact, the Skr. bhan, bhanati is “ to speak, tell, recite, preach’';
to the same family belongs Greek φωνή and φωνεῖν. All roots ex-
pressive os showing by soundS, declar-ing, etc„ denote to show and
at the same time to shine. Therefore, bhanati, bannan and φανεῖν
are nearly allied to φαίνειν, and to Skr. bhdnu, a shine, the sun,
ete. The Goth. hanam, bandvoo, ἶπημεῑοι, bandznyhn, ο. Ν, benaa,
to give a sign, beckon, etc. stand nearer to φαίνειν than to φανεῖν
or bannan. The d in bandwa may belong either to the suffix or to
a stem band, an amplified ban. Such an amplified form is repre-
sented by M. D. handen ε bannen (see Kil. i. v.)‚ and by Skr. blico-141,
to chide, censure, abusc, deride; whence ὂῆαζιᾴα, a buffoon; Pali
Margianam, quarreling‚ strife5 wholly analogous is the connexion
between A. S. gabbaa, Ο. N. gabba, to mock, and Ο. Fris. gubbia.
to banish; cs. also E. to gab, gabbery, to gabble. A similar varia-
tion between nd, and nn as in bannen, handen rectus in another
Teutonic word, viz. A. S. pending, penning, Ο. H. G. phoreim,
Ο. Ν., O. S., Ο. Fris„ and D. penning, a penny; in this instance,
too, as in ban, Skr. bhan, the Skr. shows the lingual n in pagna, a
coin; a bet, stake3 wages, hire. Both the Skr. and Teutonic
form os pana and penny show traces of being a development from
a more primitive Aryan one, which 1 need not endeavour to enquire
into, as being beyond the scope of this work.

L.

ὖ 236. For thalascicnco in 1 Ι guess that we must read {alas
giaesco (or gaisco). Talas is the genit. sg. of tala, O. H. G. nala,
numerus‚·summa, calculus, ratio; cs. N. H. G. nahlung, payment.
Giesca, gaesca = 0. H. G. eisca, petitio, exactio; D. eisch, de·
mand, pretension, exigence; 0. H. G. εἰκόνι, D. eis-chen, petere,
exigere, ciere3 giezkcdn, postulare, rogare. The O. Fris. term for
demanding, dunning, is dt-achtia ,· and considering the confusion
between sc and ft in the MSS.. it is by no means impossible that
the term intended is talus grafio. At any rate the Malb. must
contain some word expressive os exaction of payment, and, by im-
plication, the charges due sor the summonS.

§ 237. Less uncertain is bacchrammito in 2, read utchramonitho,
the dative os utcbmmmitha, literally ‘⁸ the pinching out,” i. e.
exaction. The particle ut is also found, as we have seen, in the O.
Fris. utachtia. As acht, ast and kafl, Irae-ht are apt to get con-
founded, and hramjan is synonymous with Ο. H. G. haflian, con-
nectere, tenere, D. hachten, hechten, hesteri, it is by no means
impossible that the Ο. Fris. πται-Μία represents a more original ut·
haenau, which would be wholly analogous to utcltmmmian.

ᾗ 238. The formula nexticantigyus in§ 2, etc„ is explained by
Grimm (Pret'. Lrv, sq.) as containing next, nexti, fibula, torques,
