INTRODUCTION.

THE present work was undertaken because none os the existing
editions of the Lex Sala-a afford sacilities sor that synoptic study
which is essential when we have to deal with different texts os one
document.

A great deal has already been done to make the Lex Salz'ca—the
most iinportant of the Leges Bar-baronem —accessible to students,
The first edition os it was published about the middle of the
16th century, by Jean Du Tillet, bishop of Meaux, without name of
editor, date or place of printing, under the title : Libens· sev decreta
a Clodoveo et Childeberto ἂν clothario prius aedita ac postremum a
Carolo lucide emendata auctaque plurimum. In quibus Itoec kaben-
tur Capitula ex Isidori Etymologiarum lib. V. Pactum pro tenore
pacis DD. czazdebmi ὁ· Clotharii regum. Decretio Clothan'i
regie. Smtentz‘ae de septem septenis. Lex Salicu, &c. This edi·
tion contains the Lex Emendata, and was re-issued with a fresh
title-page dated 1573. 111 1602 and 1609 a text similar to that of
Du Tillet was published by Lindenbrog, based on a collation os
several MSS. by Fr. Pithon, with a Glossary by the latter3
it was reproduced by Goldast in his Constitutiones imperiales,
tom. iii. (1610), and again by Lindenbrog in his Codex legum
antiquarum (1613). In 1665 Theod. Bignon republished the
same text with the Glossary of Pithon and Notes of Jerome
Bignon. A new collation of the Lex Emendate was published
in 1677 by Baluze, in his first vol. of the capiendam. These
editions were reproduced by Eccard, Leges Francorum et Rtspuario·
rum (1720); Schilter, Thesaurus, tom. ii. (1727) ; 6001313011, Cor-
pus-junii· Germanici (1738) ; Bouquet, Rerum Gallie. et Francic.
Scn‘pu„ tom. iv. (1541); canciani, Barbarorum, Leges, tom. ii
(1783) ; Wiarda, Ges-ch. u. Auslegung des Salika-ken Gesetzes (1808);
Walter, corpus juris Gennanici, tom. i. (1824). Different readings
found in a MS. containing'the Lex Emendate, preserved at Este,
were published (1739) by Muratori, Antiqq. Italicae Medii Aevi, ii.
286.

Of the versions containing the so·called Malberg Glosses we
have 311 edition by Herold in his Originum ac Germanicarum An-
tiquitatum libri, Basle, 1557, published from a MS. which is now
lost. His text was reprinted by Wendelin, Leges Sala-ae illustra-
tae (1649); Eccard (172o); Georgisch (1738); Bouquet (1741);
Canciani (1783); Wiarda (1808); Walter (1824). Another version
preserved in the Wolfenbiittel Cod. (Cod. 2) was published by
- Eccard (1720), and reprinted from 1113 edition by Bouquet (1741);
Canciani, vol. v. (1792); Walter (1824). The text preserved in 3
Paris Cod. (Cod. 8) was first published, but very inaccusately‚ by

Schilter (1727), and reprinted by Bouquet, Canciani (111 1113 vol. v),
and Walter. The text contained in the Munich cod. (Cod. 3) was
published in 1831 by Pros. Feuerbach.

Itis, perhaps, not too much to say that all those editions are now
out os date.

Pardessus’ Loi Solique, which appeared 111 1843, was a great irn-
provement on all previous editions, and placed the study of the Law
at once upon a firmet basis. But as he gave all the existing νει-310113
of the Lex 111 eight successive textS, his work is not easy for a com-
parative study of the different versions.

Merkel’s Lex Salica, published 111 1850 “ mit einer Vorrede von
Jacob Grimm,'’ in which he condensed all the texts of Pardessus

Ι into 0110, is not without its meritS. But in order to make one text

of a number os versions, which osten materially differ, Merkel re-
jected all various readingS, except those which related to the so-
called Malberg Glosses, and thereby deprived students of the
necessary aids for clearing up the difficulties abounding in the Lex
Salica. Nor can his division of the Lex into text and novellae be
considered judicious.

In 1874 Behrend's Lex Salica appeared as a most valuable sub-

· stitute for Merkel’s edition, though it does not afford the necessary

facilities sor synoptic study.

A synoptic edition os the Lex Salica has already been published
in 1833, by Laspeyres at Halle, but his texts cannot be relied upon,
apart from the fact that it contains only the Wolfenbiittel and
Munich codd. by the side of the texts published by Schilter,
Herold, the Lex Emendata, and the Lex Ripuariorum.

For the present edition Codd. 1-9, B, F, 6, and Codd. 4418,
Q (also called Cod. 11), T, V &c., of the L. Emendata have been
re-collated from the original MSS. by myself ; Herold’s text is
reprinted, verbatim, from his work. The Royal Library at Munich
(Librarian, Pros. Dr. Von Halm) readily sent cod. 3, the Chapter
Libraryof St. 6311011 (Librarian, the Rev. J. Idtenson) equallyreadily
despatched Codd. 9 and G to this country for my examination. In 1876
the authorities of the School of Medicine at Montpellier sent Cod. 7
to Paris for my use, and in the following summer kindly placed the
same codex at my unrestricted disposal during my stay at Montpel-
lier, while their Librarian, the Rev. Dr. Gordon, and M. le
Professeur Boucherie, treated me with great hospitality. The
Wolsenbiittel authorities considered it unsafe to send their MS.
across the sea, but the many kindnesses which I afterwards re-
ceived from their Librarian, Prof. Dr. Otto Von Heinemann‚ made
my personal visit to that town very pleasant.
