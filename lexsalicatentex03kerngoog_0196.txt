NOTES. TITT. XXXVIII. mlx.

ᾖ 198. Leodardiin 1, etc„ is out of place, and should stand in
Tit. va as the fine to ‘⁸ si caballum decotaverit (excortaverit).”
It is from such example· that we learn how the original law, nay
even the oldest Latin translation, has been dislooeted, split up· ⁸1²ss
mutilated.

ᾗ 199. The paraphrase: “id est per circumventionem de servitio
domini sui abstraxerit '⁹ belongs to the Latin sollicitare which we
find in ᾇ 1, and not to plag-tare, where the Lex Emend. and 10 have
it. Plagiare, it is nnnecessary to say, means kidnapping, and not
precisely seducing. The whole tenor of ξ 2 flatly contradicts the
interpretation of the Lex Emendata. The Malb. theolasina (¹),
etc., “ the seducing a slave” is plain and removes all doubt. As
to obscult in 1, obsculte in 2, the root agrees with Ο. N. skour,
deecit. As to the sense, obscuht would suit as well, because A. S.
scyccan (whence scucca, the seducer, Satan) is the very word for
“ sollicitare.” But as Ο. N. skolli, the evil one, agrees precisely in
this sense with A. S. scucca, there is no reason to impugn the
authority of the MSS. From the t in the ending Ι infer that
obscult stands for obsculht, a derivative from a verb which would be
formally identical with E. to sculk. Ob may be either os = Goth.
us, under, or -ι Goth. as, A. S. os, dial. D. of,· neither will affect
the notion of obscult. The uanslators took it sor os= as, as may
be gathered from abstrahere in the misplaced paraphrase.

ᾗ 200. Uin'dio (read win'dio) in ᾇ 2 of 10 is the O. Fris. τσίηὶ,
werde, judicial proof, assertion os rights (cf. the passages in Richth.
Gloss. i. v. werde, 2). The word, along with its collateral forms,
as Ο. Fris. warande, war-ende, M. D. warande, custodia, defensio,
cautio, assertio (see Kil. i. v.‚) M. S. gernere, werscap, N. H. G.
gewei’lare, etc., is of so wide an application in the ancient Teutonic
lawa that it is not easy to find a satisfactory equivalent in our
modern tongues. In the present case “ judicial proof ” or asser-
tion of one’s rights by adducing the legal proof would be the most
suitable. How this proof was to be given forms the subject of ᾗ 2
sq. in cod. a, etc.

The readings of the other codd. are mere variatione of win'drb,
better wirdio. In 2 wirthanb is intended3 in 6 windan'o,· in 7-9
werwan’o. That this term here used as ‘⁸ cautio, defensio, vindi-
cation of rights ” is originally identical with werdere, war-dere,
wear-der, arrha, arrhabo, auctoramentum, treated in Tit. VI, is
proved by the fact that A. S. verbor-lt (²), D. waarborg, means gua-
rantee‚ guaranty, in combination with the other fact that M. D.
maer-gela == mam-gela is ‘⁴ arrha, auctoramentum.”

ᾗ 201. For mallo, malo we must probably read in mallo (malo),
in the public assembly, that is to say, in court. 1 take o to be the
sign of the instrumenta13 cf. the construction an thiu in Heliand
99, 6, with M. D. r‘ndien, in eo nt, si.

ξ 202. The quasi-Latin war-gare, only found in the family of
MSS. represented by 7-9, B-H, as a paraphrase of “plagiare,”
presupposes a Frank. wargcin, different from wargr‘an, Goth.
(ζώνιον-ἄγονα, etc., to doom. According to analogous derivatives,
it may signify “to treat one wolf-like, rob one,’' as well as “ to
reduce one to the state of marg, i. e. outlaw.'’ Since the notions
of “ outlaw,” exile, and wretch, pass into one another, as we see
from A. S. meccea, mecca, wraecca, E. wretch, and its cognate

words, there is no reason to doubt the correctness of mergare, or to
change it into ταωνι. nat, according to Teutonic law no less
tha‘n to the ancient Roman, even he who is involuntarily an exsul
was looked upon in the light of a banished man, may still be traced
in a passage in the Fris. LL. 48, where the words: “Jef thene
mon Normen nimath ande hat (i. e. nt) of londe sereth werth sun-
der willa and mith nrwald’' have been rendered: “Si virum
quempiam Normanni accipiunt (¹) et ille in exilium vel uter-londes
ductus fuerit.’'

ᾗ 203. Fnbsalchino in 73 fhbsalcr'no (read flrbsalgino) in 8, 93
subsaltouo (read sn‘ofalclrono) in ro is the genit. or dat. c. of a
sem. stem in ηἰα. It is a compound of the stem fria, Goth. snja
(nomin. frear), etc., free, and salchim'a, salchom‘a, the nom. act.
of a verb, Ο. Η. G. salgy’an, git-algen, subtrahere, attrectare, usur·
pare. On comparing what has been remarked about this verb
under Tit. X, we obtain the result that it is aptly rendered both by
plagr'are and by ‘⁸ per ‹ircumventionem de servitio domini sui ab·
strahere.’' It is, no doubt, owing to the Frank. word expressing
both notions that the paraphrase “ per circumventionem de servitio
domini sui abstrahere ’² has been applied to plag-iare. We have
seen above that this paraphrase is misapplied where the Latin word
was used, but it is true that salchian denotes as well ‘⁶ sollicitare,
i. e. per circumventionem abstrahere ’⁹ as ‘⁶ plagiare.” The same am·
biguity is observable in the D. word ver-mnsam, to decoy, to
kidnap, to barter away, to sell unlawfully. Falchom‘a belongs to a
verb of the ὁ· class (cf. msam‘a) ,· salchim‘a to one of the ai· or ia·
class. The form with a, precisely answering to rqfam'a and the
like, occurs in salchem, read salchem· or salchanu in 10. For
falconii in 2 read falgono orsalchono.

The translation, or we might say interpretation, of salchimb is
found in the Latin “ plagiare,” whereas “vendere ’' is intended as
the equivalent of audelsecto in 10, chaldefhv, chaldeficlro in 6. In
this corrupted term 1 see traces of a mixture of two readings,
namely handeseltlao, chandesalmm, and handefilgo, chandeselclrto.
Handeseltho, Ο. N. handseld, is a derivative from handesalian,
Ο. N. honaugia, al. hands-ala, tradere in manum, tradere ven·
ditione, whence handsal (s. Oxf. Dict.), i. e. etymologically, of
course, E. handsel. In composition with sm we have the word in
D. ver-hamelen, to barter away3 to sell, dispose of in a clan-
destine or unlawful way.

In the hypothetical reading handefflgv, chandefilcko, filgo (selchin)
would be a fem. subst. derived from ‘sellium tradereg cf. Goth.
filhan, Ο. S. selahan, Ο. Ν. sela, etc„ to which belongs Ο. H. G.
scili, D. vell, venalis, etc. It may be supposed that the Franks
possessed a word handeselltan or handefallrjan, which in meaning
was wholly or nearly the same as handesalaeim.

The reviser of 6 should have corrected fanclramo into salchamb,
which is sufficiently clear by itsolf and confirmed by fuleham (read
folchuni) in 10. It may be that the corrector discovered in the term
the word stunc, fiee, a free man, M. D. mne, the dative of which
would be smncamo. He might the more easily have been led to this
conjecture by having seen frio in the other MSS. just a few lines
before. The cla has a High-·Frankish tinge, but the scr-ihc of 6
shows more instances of the same tendency, e. g. in replacing an
original p by ph. We should not lay too much st‘ress on this trifie,
sor even a scribe entirely ignorant of any Frank. dialect might have

been tempted to the conjecture [ητα-ᾖσθα», because franc was one
