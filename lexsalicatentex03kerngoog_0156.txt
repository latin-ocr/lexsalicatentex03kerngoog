 

NOTES. TITT. 1. 11.

Cod. 1, and of mallare in Cod. 2. Re is common enough in
Frankish and even in M. H. G. as a variation of er, ir, e.g. refizn-
gan, rqfhgnusst' in the Gl. Lips.; resldt and rzlrlag in the Psalms
(Heyne‚ Kl. D. p. 177). Like the Goth. us it often means again ,-
e.g. Goth. usgiban = ἀποδοῦναι, Lat. reddere ,· so too in O. H. G.
inventare, revocare (cf. Grimm, D. G. ii. 823). Reapten, reabtena
. would consequently be ‘ the act of re-banning,’ and moreover
denote the fine imposed on him who has disregarded the aftena or
summons of the judge. Is this be the true interpretation of the
term, the reading mallare ahtena in 2 is wrong, and must ‘be
changed into malb. reabtena.

ᾗ 8. Calcium in 1 contains three errors (cf. above, β 2 and ᾇ 5)“.
we have to read chaltio or gaitae, which is a diminutive os a supposed
Frank. galli or galtu, = Ο. Ν. gb'ltr, a bear or hog, and may be
regarded as identical with O. N. galti. The corresponding fem. is
O. N. gylta, O. H. G. gulsa, getza, sucula; cs. A. S. gille, M. E.
yelt, Ο. N. gyltr, Dan. and Swed. galt. Chalteo in ὁ and 10 differs
from chaltz'o only in spelling, whereas chalti in 7 and 9 is almost
the Ο. N. gyltr, which exactly agrees with chulti in 83 cf. also
provinc. N. H. G. golze. Dialti in 7 is a misread chalti.

ᾇ 9. The word which forms a compound with chalcio and chatti,
chalti, is variously written chrane, chr-anne, branuc, chramne,
hramne, etc. In the O. H. G. version of the Lex Salica it has
been rendered by suga, E. seve,- no doubt correctly, for in Tit.
LXXXI we read : “ Si quis porcellum lactantem de rane furaverit,”
which goes sar to prove that rane signifies some enclosed place.
Stealing from an enclosure was a greater crime than stealing from
an open place. Hence the person stealing even a very young
chramne-chaltz'o, i.e. a stye-porker‚ has to pay three times more
than another who steals a somewhat older pig from a field. The
Latin text, stating that the thest of a ‘¹ porcellus lactans” is to be
punished with 120 denarii, but‘that of a “ porcellus [de campo] qui
sine matre vivere possit ’⁹ with only 40 denarii, would be absurd,
save for the difference of the two kinds of theft.

The genuine form of the word is probably chramne, hramne.
From the fact that the D. boed, though etymologically identical
with E. booth, G. bade, means ⁴‘ a pig-stye,” whilst the D. kraam,
Ο. H. G. krdm, means “ a booth,’' I infer that chramne is a varia-
tion of kraam ,· because in the Teutonic languages the combinations
kr and Izr may be said to be twin representatives os Aryan kr, just
as kl and hl, kn and lm are of Asyan kl and kn. Again‚ from some
Slavonic words horrowed from a Teutonic source, Ι inser that the
Goth. form os chramne must have been hramini (stem hraminja)
or lammina, whence Slavonic chramina, a house; cf. Russian cho-
rdmina, a room; chordmy‚ a wooden house. It is scarcely acci-
dental that up to the present day a sow is called krdm, briem, in
some parts of Westphalia (¹) ; the Teuthonista has cryme, i.e. soege
(D. zeuge); the original meaning of this kaim, cryme, as derived
with a lost suffix from krdm, a booth, a stye, must have been “a
stye-porker. ’ ’

ἕ 10. Lere in 10, mutilated to re in 7 and 9, is evidently quite a
different word; les in 6 is better. It is radically the same as
Goth. lasiws (ἀσθενής), superl. laszssmostu A. S. lassa, laest and
larest (¹); E. less, Ζῆτα,- Ο. F τίς. lessa, lerest. Identical with les

in 6 is A. S. loes in Cnut’s LawS, iii, 2 ε “ ex mediocribus homini-
bus (quos Angli laespegnas nuncupant, Dani vero yoongmen
vocant).” Les and laes look like comparativeS, notwithstanding
the ending of the strong declension; lere is rather the positive, i.e.
the Goth. casabus, unless it stand for lerere. The approximately
correct reading will be in 6: chramnechalte‚ leschalti; in 7 and 9:
chmmnechalti, lerechalti; in 10: hramnechalti. lerechalti. Both
terms may be regarded as synonymous‚ the former properly denot-
ing a pig still kept in the stye, the other a younger or very young
pig in general.

§ 1 1. Unum tualepti in 6, unum ahelepte in 10, express the fine to
be paid. We must read kann-tualepti (pron. twaleflae), A. S. hund-
twegftaejgr ,· or (if unum be right) tualepti, which would stand to
the A. S. word in the same relation as E. seventy to A. S. hund-
seosontzjg.

§ 12. The reading dira‘m' in 3 is clearly a mistake for chramni ,⁶
chrinne in 8 probably stands for claremne, chremm', the e being
the Umlaut caused by the i in the final syllable of the stem. Such
an e occasionally passes into ῖς e g. in the Frank. Psalms we find
ind for endi, andi (cf. Heyne‚ Kl. D., i. v.). Char in 2 would
suggest the so-called M. Lat. hara, but the cod. is a bad one and
has little authority where it differs srom all the others.

§13. A ‘⁴ porcellus qui sine matre vivere possit” is termed
chranecalcz‘nm (i.e. chramnechaltio) in 1 t doubtless an error. The
word inzymus‚ i. e. ingymus (which we find in the corresponding
ᾗ of 2, etc.)‚ applies as well to pigs as to neat, sheep, and goats (see
below). It is either the genit. case of a word ingym, ‘⁸ a period of
one year or winter‚” or a derivative from the same word signisying
“ a one year (winter) old animal’' or “a yearling.” The root of
inzymus—and of gymis and tuzgimus in Tit. 111 (see below)—is
gym, i.e. gim or gim, in which we recognise the Slav. eima, winter,
Gr. χειμών, Lat. hiems, Bactr. sim, Skr. heman (¹). Der-ivatives
from it are Lat. bimus (for bi-bimus) and tn'mus,· Gr. χίμαρος, a
young goat, a yearling: Icel. gimbr (gymbr), a ewe lamb, and
germ-i, a one year old sheep ; Scotch, gimmer (²).

Ing-imus is the same as girans, compounded with the car-
dinal number ln, the vowel of which has been lightened owing
to the combination of consonants following, upon the same prin-
ciple as in 0. N. flestr, mestr‚ ekkja (older enkja), for fleirtr,
meas-tr, einkja,· in A. Sax. ellefne, andlufon,· E. ele-ven, (sor
elleven); in O. Fris. andlova, alvene, elle-ven in D. *df for εεζίς
twintzg for troentig. Gymus has its counterpart in Icel. vetrungr,
Lat. anniculus, O. H. G. jar-ig, while ingymus corresponds to
N. H. G. einffi‘hnjgr, D. ewinter, enter (for cenwinter, one winter,
i.e. year, old), Skr. ekahdyana.

As regards the final syllable us, is, it would seem to be rather
some secondary suffix than the sign of the genit. case. For a de-
rivative gina-is, gum-us, would be quite analogous to the Icel.
vetrungr, and the E. yearling. The' form of the suffix is that of
the diminutive ending εἰς, es, s, in D., e. g. dreumis, a dapperling‚
hors, a bear (cf. Ο. N. bersi); much used in proper nouus, espe-
cially femin. one3‚ as Mies, Polly; Jans, Jenny. The same or a
kindred suffix, but used in the neuter gender, is the Icel. si in
hryssi (merhryssi ,· unghryssz') ; nearly allied also is the Icel. si of
weak masculineS, and sa of feminines; e. g. hersi, kussi, lar-ia,

(²) The quantity of the vowel must be lest undecided, the more so because it

strikingly varies in the cognate languages. The aze in the worthless cod. 3, and
sometimes in 8, is a mistaken tsi.
