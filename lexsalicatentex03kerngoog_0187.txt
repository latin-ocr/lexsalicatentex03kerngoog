NOTES. TITT. XXVII. XXVIII. XXIX.

by Aelsric’s Gen. 45, 6 where we see : “ Nu twa gear waes hungor
ofer ealle 0016211 and git sceolon fise, on pam man ne maeg 112801
110 en'cm ne ripun.” A repetition os uver is unnecessary, according
to a well-known principle. Quite so in the Fris, LL. 475, 35:
“om een raeserd jestha scerd (of course: raefscerd) jeftha meta (of
course: raefmeta).” Another explanation would be that andrepp
was taken for a compound with and “ unlawfully,” about which see
notes on Titt. XLV and LI. As according to this interpretation
andr-epp and amr-epp would amount to the same thing, the omis-
sion osone os the two terms in 10 might be accounted sor.

It may be objected that the Latin text shows no word for reap-
ing. True, but the case stated in 'the paragraph is practically an
absurdity. It would be sheer solly in any man to plough and sow
his neighbour's field without reaping it, or at least trying to do s0.
The Franks could have had no desire to punish a man simply be·
cause he chose ot' his own accord to throw away time, labour, and
grain, merely for the benefit of his neighbour. It is difficult to say
where and how the error originated. The translators probably used
a somewhat corrupted source, and it is not unlikely that the para-
graph, in its original shape‚ ran somewhat in this way: ‘⁴ Is a man
ploughs and σκοτω- another’s field, he will be punished (ort have to
pay a 11110) for unlawsul ploughing and cutting.” The translator, 1
fancy, read saith or seith (Ο. S. said, D. zaaz't, A. S. sama), sows
(or rather the 3rd pers. subj.) instead of scer-ich (O. F ris. sceretlr,
Ο. N. skm), moWS, 2110215.

§ 152. Auuerphe in 6 and anhunerbo in 10, combined with
cunae-rso in 7, ckuuarso in 8, chucarso in 9, contain all the data
necessary for the restoration of the true reading. In 6 an (or av)
werpheis intended; in 10 an (or av) hwer60; in 7-9 (an or as)
chmrfo, ckwerso, i. e. the instrumental or dative sg. os werf, wag-f,
already known to us (cs. ᾖ 122). We see here the original h (ch)
preserved, except in 6. An hwerfe is ‘⁴ in the yard‚” etc. ς av
hwerse ‘⁶ from the yard.” The Latin text decides nothing, the Lex
Emend. having ‘⁸ in campum,'’ the other codices ‘⁴ de campo.'’

For theonam (in ἦ 25) see Tit. XXV.

ᾖ 153. Subtho in 10, subto in 6 (pron. susto), seems connected
with Fris, soche, according to Kil. ‘⁸ palla, muliebre vestimentum,”
and a contractiori for swibto or swabto ‚· cs. O. H. G. (umbi) swetst,

perizoma, femorale3 but also E. swath and D. swachtel, fascia, -

mitella.

ᾖ 154. For alachis cido in 6, alachescido in 10, read alachis scida,
alaches scida, or perhaps tido. Α laches, alachis is a regular genit.
of the word which we find rendered in Tit. XIV by ‘⁴ villa ’⁹ (cs.
above, ὁ 87). Scido is ‘⁸ the spoiling, undoing,” as 1 have en-
deavoured to show under Tit. XXIV. Tido for tide‘o would be a
substantive belonging to a verb tidian, Ο. F riS. ιίᾱία, Μ. D. tiden,
trahere.

XXVIII.

ἦ 155. nealal-ina in t comes too late, as it belongs to ξ 2 5 of the
preceding chapter. It is remarkable that blunders of this kind are
far more frequent 111 1 111211 111 1110 other codd.

Morter (read morther) in 2 is Goth. maurpr, A. S. morb'er,
murder. The repetition of the term shows that both the per-
petrated deed and the proved design fall under the head of monher.
That seulan desa, seulan docfa (i. e. ddja or doefa) is but another
term for mor-ther is evident from the Malb. iu 6 and 10.

ξ 156. Tua in 7—9 is ‘⁸ two,” in the femin. or neut. gender, O. S.
trva. Auuena in 10 is a misread mena, tw0, in the mascul., O. S.
twtna. Τ110 word is certainly not in its place in the first paragraph ς

503

its purport, if it stood iu par. 2, would be to intimate that both
the originator os the plot, he who bribes another to perpetrate the
crime, and the other who accepts the commission, are guilty of
murder. In the A. S. Laws both are hanan, murderers; the former
is called roedbana, the latter daedbana ; Aethelr. VIII, 23 ς Ηο111. 85.

ὁ 157. The Latin text is miserably corrupted in the older codices ;
in 2 11 is simply gibberish. The cause of the deficient state of the
text in 1 may be that the reviset did not catch the meaning of in
furtum, i. e. stealthi]y; or “elocare ” must in his eye have had
the pregnant sense of “taking a hireling,” i. e. a hired murderer.
The phrase ‘⁴ et pretium—acceperit '⁹ in ξ 1 of the Lex Emend. and
10 is a Teutonism, in so 121 as et takes the place of a relative pro-
noun, and the subject of ‘⁴ acceperit ” is not “quiS,” but “ali-
quem.” Another example os this peculiarity of the old Teutonic
idioms occurS, for instance, in Tit. H, ᾗ 3 os 102 ‘⁸ Si quis porcel-
lum de sute furaverit et clavem habuerit.”

The whole Title in the Lex Salica differs considerably from
Tit. 11 of the Lex Frisonum and the A. S. Laws of Ine and
Aethelb., where the traitor is much more passive than in our Lex,
and is not regarded as the mental author of the crime, the doedbana,
but as one who wickedly assists the perpetrator of the crime. It
would seem that the legal provisions are deficient on both sides; no
one will doubt that treachery in its different aspects was equally
known amongst Frank5, Frisians, and English.

XXIX.

ᾖ 158. Sicu· in 2, secti and sectlze (i. e. sechte) in 6, secti in 7-9,
sichte and sochte in ιο, is Ο. Fris, εει-111, syba-ht, a wound‚ sore,
disease‚ Goth. saum, Ο. N. sau, Ο. H. G., O. S., and A. S. subt,
D. sucht. For the e or i in the radical syllable cs. Ο. H. G. treh-
tin = truhtin, and (a third form without Umlaut) O. S. drohtin,
M. D. drochtnj'n, etc. The e and i in the termination is that of a
genit. or dat. case3 01. suste, pestilentiae, Gl. L. 874 ; datives in ι’
or e of femin. stems in i need no 101010110ος 211 accusat. of such
stems in e (i)'is alien to Ο. S., but occurs ‚occasionally in O. Fris.
and A. S. (¹). The stem is, of course, sichti, sockti, etc.; in the

Malb. a genit. or dative case is intended, depending upon some term
like Inita, a mulct, fine.

ᾖ 159. Chanu‘nus, chaminis, is a derivative from chamian, Ο. Fris.
hamma, hemma, to pinch (cf. Tit. XX), and coordinate to a sup-
posed verb chanu'non, substantially the same as Ο. Fris. (humilia),
homelia (hemilia), to cn'pple, undo; whence homelenga, hemilinge,
truncatio ς s, Richth. Gloss. i. vv. Chaminis I take to be the gen.
sg. of chamini& ,· cf. such Ο. S. genitives as custes, giburdies,
weroldes ,· chamr'nus may be the same, or belong to a vicarious
form chaminid. ¹

Chamin in 10 is also a femin„ its stem being chamim'a ,· one
would rather expect a dat. chamina, chaminO, chamine. In 7-9 we
ought to read chramine, chmmene, a feminine, and a derivative from
chramian, which in Tit. XXwe have found to be synonymous with
chanaan in the sense of pinching; as to the connexion os the ideas
cf. Germ. quencken, to pinch, bruise, with Dutch ἑωράκη, to wound,
hurt.

ᾗ 160. The Malb. alatham, etc„ repeated twice over in 2, 6, and
10, receives light from the following passage of the F iis, LL. (444,
ξ 10)1 “]01“1112 manne thi thssma offe is bi tha cnocla, soe send

(²) E. g. nate, Metra 29, 36; 0. Fris. atde, Fris. LL. 144, 24.
