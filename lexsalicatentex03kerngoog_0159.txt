NOTES. TITT. 11. 111.

‘⁸ tame,” “ mansuetus,” is also expressed by the synonymous chuc-
cham of 2, read thuchtham, a bad, but not uncommon, spelling for
tuchttam ,· cf. thesewun sor tesewun, Gl. L. 909; thui sor tui, Gl.
A. 4. As tucht is Ο. Η. G. zuht, a feeding, breeding, and tam is
‘⁶ tame,” the compound tuchttam may be said to express the same
idea as thammodo. Further on (cs. Titt. Vand X) are found other
examples of this confusion of rh or m with th. Mammod(o) may
have been intended for O. Η. G. mammont, mansuetus

ᾗ 25. The other codd. exhibit a well-known term sor “maialis,”
with another word added to express “votivuS, sacrivus.” A
“ maialis ” in general is called barach or breche, read barcho, in 63
barca, read bargo, or brarecho, read barecha, in 103 barecha. hracho,
bratho, bartho, read barcho, in 7, 8, 9. It is, of course, the A. S.
beamg, beorh ,· E. barrow ,· D. burg, barch, dial. berg ,⁶ Ο. N.
bb'rgr; O. H. G. baruch, barch, maialis; Fris. baerch and Nor-
thumb. berg, porcus. The final 0 in barecho is either the sign
of the nom. in the weak decl. masc. or of a dative in the strong
declension. ’

§ 26. For anomeo anitheotha in 10, amco amiteotha in 6, Ι would
read anemeo antcheeta or antcheeto. Anemeo is the weak nomin.
masc. osa verbal adj. artemi, formed like Goth. andanems, etc. Even
anomi is not wholly inadmissible, because it would have its exact
counterpart in such forms as Lat. eximius ‚· Skr. namya ,· gamya ,-
daya, etc. The verb, in either case, is *animam to take up, to take
off (cf. A. S. animan, tollere, adimere, Ettm. Lex. 2403 Grein, Gl.
33); thus animi or anomi will be Gr. ἐξαίρετσς. Antcheeta is a
regular dative of a word corresponding to Ο. Η. G. anthezka,
votum, but of the strong decl. Or it may be the weak nomin.
masc. os an adj. derived from the same root, i. e. be identical with
O. Η. G. antheizzo, devotus, and O. S. antheti (acc. sg. fem.
andhettia, anthitau), devotuS, sponsus. Such an adj. would stand
to the subst. in nearly the same relation as in Lat. votivus to
votum ; cf. O. N. heitdagr, a votive day 3 heithlezsfr, a votive loaf 3
cf. Oxf. Dict. i. vv. The spelling eo instead of ee, Goth. a'i, D. ee,
is rather a clerical error than a peculiarity of Frank pronunciation.
1 do not think that in order to defend the reading of the codd. we
can appeal'to the Ο. Fris. liova for leem, A. S. laefan, O. N. lufo,
since in this particular case the 0 is due to the influence os the sol-
lowing labial. Such an erroneous eo for ee recurs in a variant of
chariocheto in Tit. 111 (q. w).

Cahimo in 7 and 8, caimo in 9, seems a modification osgam’mo,
which would be radically the same as αηὲηιεος cf. O. H. G.
gandmi, acceptable; whence ungendme in daz opplzer was unge.
ndme (Graff, Spr. ΙΙ, 1073). The i, supposing it to be long, may in
Frankish stand for ἐ = d, or rather may be its Umlaut. The sound
of ἐ, whether arising from an older ἀ or a‘i, is apt to pass into ἰ,
chiefly, but not exclusively, when the Subsequent syllable has an i ,-
several instances of ἰ for ἐ (= ἅ) are sound in Gothic; those of ἰ
sor ἐ (= a'i) are not very rare in the Heliand; e. g. gem-inid for
gehrem'd ,· gehilian ,· fullistian ‚· mira ,· see Schmeller's ed., vol. 2,
p. 184.

ᾖ 27. A common barrow is also termed habene in 10, baboni in 9,
bahane in 8, badium· in 7, hog begine in 6. The di in 7 is a mis-
reading of ch, so that the b in the other codd. is an error, and should
be read h = ch, a quasi H. G. spelling sor c. The M. D. bake,
a hog and bacon, O. H. G. bacho, perna, would require a F rank.
bacO, which, as we see, is not identical with the forms quoted above.
Along with bake, however, we find in M. D. an acc. sing. boken,
which, if regular, cannot but belong to a nomin. baken (M. Stoke 5,
811). 11· an oblique case is intended, asorm hacine for the gen. and

*447

dat„ and bacane sor the accus.. would be right. Bog in 6 is a
doubtful reading. One might be tempted to read borg ω barg (see
above) ς but in comparing it with the Latin siz-e and in alia mente
os the other codd. we see that it may possibly represent a corrupt
hot, i. e. aut, “or,'’ which in the Latin ,of the Lex is used in the
sense os sive, exactly as ou in French.

§ 28. The term sor a herd of twenty-five swine, sunesta, sumis-ta,
sonis-ta, etc., is radically the same as A. S. suner, sanor. In the
Lex Ripuar. tit. 18, sonesti, sontis-ta is defined tobe : “ 12 equae cum
admissariO, aut 6 scrofae cum verre, vel 12 vaccae cum tauro ” ; see
Ducangei. v. and Grimm‚ G. D. S. 383. In the Lex Salica a herd of
swine comprises a number varying from 25 to 50, according to cir·
cumstances. There is nothing strange in such a discrepancy between
the two lava. Nevertheless it may be questioned whether the Lat.
version be wholly accurate, as a distinction between “ 25 porci ubi
amplius in grege illo non fuerint '⁹ and ‘⁴ 5ο porci'' or ‘⁶ 50 porei et
si adhuc aliqui remaneant ” is rather strange, the more so because
in both instances the same term, sonis-ta, is appended. The addition
of ingymus in 2, though at a wrong place, suggests the idea that in
the original Frank. text the term sunesta in the context, where it
occurs the first time, was intended to convey the meaning of “ a
complete herd,” i. e. a herd including boar, sow, and pigs, but
further on, at the words “ si amplius super 25 remanserint,” a herd
of only “ 25 young pigs '' without boar and sow, consequently an
ingymus-sonesta.

§ 29. Sonischalt, as ιο writes here and in Titt. ΙΙΙ and IV , can·
not contain sonis or som'st and chalt, a pig. There is no question os
pigs in the two Titles just mentioned in which sontis-chau occurs “
twice. It is a misreading for sonirthalt, i.e. sonzirtalt. Stalt sor
staltb or stald (cs. O. Η. G. scdsestalta, caulaS, Graff, Spr. VI,
667) must mean the same as stathl or stadl, statio (cs. A. S. stabol,
Ο. Fris, stathul, Ο. S. stadal, with A. S. stad, armentum equorum 3
Ο. Η. G. stuot, etc., but especially Russian stada, a herd; stanitsa,
a flock, a troop).

The unmeaning tua Zymzkfitmiha chunna, in 10, evidently de·
notes the amount of the fine specified‚ viz. two thousand five
hundred denarii. The approximately correct reading will be tua
thusundzfimti (Ρ O. N. fimt, a number of five, or finvi, five) chunna.
In the Chunnas (see col. 424) the equally corrupt numbers are tholo·
condi uueth chunna, al. thotho‘cundifitme chunna. The origin ot
the error in 10 is obscure. Can there be any connexion between
symis and the inzymus of 2 ? Or did there exist some word super-
ficially like sonistchalt and synonymous with magymis, a two years
old pig ? Without discussing this question further, by reading:
sonzzetalt, tua thusundifimti (or finvi) chunna, we get a combina-
tion entirely in the style os the F n'S. laws; e. g. wfflrtreuene, sex-
tene pennyngar, or tlu'u Mgheste soldlde, fif merl· and tua enm
jefthafiuwer withethar and ennefia-e‘th (Fris, LL. p. 95).

The lt os texachalt in 10 is a curious repetition of the same letters
in sonischalt,· this time undoubtedly a mere error. Stin worse is
exochalt, of which we have already treated in ᾖ 21. '

ᾖ 30. Pedero in 1, protero in 2, etc., cannot be the Frank. equiva-
lent os ‘⁴ vitulus lactanS,” since the very same word is applied in the
next§ but one to a ‘⁴ vacca cum vitulo.'' Hence it must have had a
much wider meaning, viz. that of a young cow or a young animal.
The forms of the word vary between podem and potero (read
pothero) in 1, pondero in 6,podor in 8, 9, pordor andpodor in 7,
