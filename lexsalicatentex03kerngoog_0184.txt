NOTES. TITT. XXV. XXVI.

man, etc„ Ο. Fris. main brekma, werthma, the latter being a variety
oswerthmond, in meaning == A. S. weotuma ,· Goth. ahma, hliuma ;
Ο. H. G. wahsamo, Frankish wahsemo, wasme in Gl. L. and Psalms,
etc. Bahmund and bac-hmani therefore arelegitimate vicarious form&
standing to each other well-nigh in the same relation as O. Fris.
wer-thmond to wamma, whereas Ο. Fris. wetma (for wedma), A'. S.
weotuma, M. D. wedem are mere varieties os a word which in Latin
has survived in vadimonium (¹).

Light is thrown upon bach or bach by Ο. N. bugga, to hinder;
bagi, inconvenience3 baglafir, broken, maimed3 bdgindi, pl. diffi-
culties, distress3 bdgskaddr, distressed (s. Oxr. Dict. i. vv.) ;
O. H. G. bah, kepah, corrupto; bubernet-o, vitiato vel scabro (see
Graff, Spr. 111, 29). Bahemer is an extremely interesting word;
as to its meaning and the suffix it entirely agrees with Skr. pdmara,
scurvy, miserable; a knave. The Skr. suffix mara is properly a
secondary one, and denotes intensity, e. g. in glumam, voracious,
lickerish3 afmara, stony; pdmara, etc. Such formations point to
a primary formation of substantives and adjectives in man. There-
sore bahemer points to a lost bahem, which would be a vicar-ious
form os habemani, bahemom‘, bahemund. From the instances
adduced from Ο. N. we gather that the notion of distress, pressure,
is prominent, the same may be said of Goth. naulis, Ο. 8. ηὸιί,
angustia, perieulum, violentia, A. S. ned, etc. 3 Ο. Fris. ned, D.
ποσά, Ο. Ν. ηιγδ, need, distress. Hence we get the equation :
Fris. nedmund .-.-. Frank. hahmund, bachmom', the former derived
from a verb neda, nedgr'a, O. N. neyUa, to sorce3 κατίδῃ, to ravish;
whence naufigan, ravishing = 0. Fris. nedmrmd.

It is not clear for what purpose hahmundo, bachmom'o-not
unlikely'an instrum. case meaning “ by way of ravishing”—should
stand where we find it. Paragraph 4 os cod. 2 contains two
clauses, but there is only question of one act, which, however, may
have two totally different issues. Now, as the term for the act
itselfis of much more importance than that sor its results, it would
appear that hahmundo, etc„ is misplaced; in short, that the Malb.
represents the subject matter, the rubric, perhaps, of the whole ᾗ in 2,
and of the two corresponding ss in the other codd.

ᾗ 135. Anthamo in 6, 7, 8, 9, authanioin 10 is more awkward than
it seems at first sight. The most probable correction—sor in the
shape in which the word appears it is quite meaningless—will be
by reading antlia-vio, the nom. action. of anthdvian, a word as am-
biguous as the Latin ‘⁶ tollere ’² ς it is the Ο. H. G. anthevan,
intheban, etc„ sustentare, sufferre3 differre; anthabdn, sustinere,
torquere, suscipere (s. Graff, Spr. IV, 818 and 73o>; Ο. S. antheb-
bian, sustinere3 D. outheffen, to deprive, exempt. Anthavia there-
fore signifies, at one time “ the taking up,” at another ‘⁸ the taking
away.” It would seem that the translators did not wholly agree
about the choice of the rendering3 sor antlia-via if interpreted in the
sense of ‘⁸ the taking up, taking to one’s se1f” may have given rise
to the Latin ‘⁸ in coniugium associaverit,” whereas the other inter·
pretation is represented by “invitam traxerit ’⁸ of ι. It is for this
reason that 1 would prefer an ambiguous word, and such a one is
antkafia. It is all the more difficult to arrive at a satisfactory con-

(²) Ι have not the slightest doubt that along with wertkmond there once
existed a word mamona, as wed is the word here required, guar-anteed by tho
English weddshg and wedlock, not to speak of the regular confusion in Frisian
between ni (rib) and d. The high antiquity of med is proved by Skr. wadhfl,
sponsa, §pou-03 the so-called root wadk properly means ‘⁴ to bind, to slay ”5

clusion because by a slight change we get amtam'o, the dative of
amtam', ‘⁴ ancilla.”

ᾗ 136. The two formulam, one sor the solemn manumission of a
litu, the other for that of a slave, must necessarily contain the same
words, except the difference of litu and slave. Not one of the codd.
with the single exception of 10 approaches the required reading,
and by giving sels-contradictory evidence they put themselves out
os court. After a slight correction in the readings of 10 we get the
following formulas :

malth0: the atomeo, lito!
malth0: the atomeo‚ theo!
i. e. ‘⁴ (si) concionetur (dicat): te libero, lite,’' or “serve.” Malcho
is the 3rd sing. pres. subj. of matthan, malthoian, A. S. maffe-
lian, ηιαδοίἰαη, praet. mavelode ; neeman, mabam, to speak,
deliver a speech3 Goth. mapljan, etc. The metathesis of matblo
into maltha has its exact counterpart in the D. naald, needle, sor
nddl ,· Ο. Fris. neld by the side of nedl ; cf. A. S. bold and boa
(bodl). sse subj. mood will be governed by a word like ‘⁸ ir” or
“whosoever.” The = A. S. pe, Ο. 8. tbi, te, atdmeo -.-. Ο. 8.
atdmeo, monaco, libero. Lito and theo are vocative cases of litu,
O. Fris. letma, alitus (letus), serf, and theo, a slave. Letu in 1, and
leto (as we must read in 6) are legitimate vicarious forms. For chi
in 6 and hiin 2, lsi‚fi, andsrin 7, 8, 9 read tbi, Ο. 8. tlu’, te. The
use of the oratio directa is a constant rule in the old Teutonic
Laws wherever a formula is introduced; e. g. Grag. 1, 3922 “l-:f
mai5r maelir svfi,'’ “pfl skalt gjalda mer vassmal ok skil ek fra annat
fe allt,” ‘⁸ pa komrat hann ὅδῐο vii5.” So, too, in the Fris. LL.,
e. g. 152, 12: “Hwersa ma spreck umbe en gold and spreke,”
“ic nebbe nen undhent,” ‘⁴ sa undgunge hi mith sinre sele ”; s. also
59⁹ ι’ sqq·

Among the numerous blundeis os the MSS„ both in the Latin
text and the Malb„ some are so instructive that they deserve to be
pointed out, in the first place those which are occasioned by the
manner of pronouncing the semi-Latin (Galloromance) of the period.
In 1 and 2 we see tus meo ; the scribe, unacquainted with the Frank.
word atomeo, separated the syllables, and as a final s was but slightly
sounded or not at all, he expressed the sound ὃ, which in his ears
had a sound between ὃ and 12, by us. Those who are in the habit os
writing a final s, inherited from an ancient language, but no more
sounded, will be prone to add the same mute letter where there is
no etymologica] reason sor such an addition (²). The repeated d in
6 instead of t points to such a state of the Romance language of the
country as has continued in Spanish; in other words, the people of
F rauce, who used the Roman idiom, no longer pronounced the t, e.g.
in potest, amatus, but sounded a d, just as in Spanish we find
poder, amado ,· they had not yet reached the later French pronun-
ciation in which the letter was wholly dropt. It is not only in
the Malb. that we observe ledo and adema, but also lidus in text
4. Lexri in 2 can only be explained by supposing that the process
of corruption had been going on through several generations of
MSS. A first step in the wrong direction was that the true read-
ing leto was altered by being spelt letum or lecum, because in the
language of the scribe um and o were interchangeable soundS.
Lecum by a second wrong step became corrupted into leccim ,· cf.

(¹) It seems to me that the French spelling ofje mels and suchlike words
is, at least partly, due to the same remu.
