' NOTES. TIT. XXXVIII.

seli, sili, Dan. sele, harness3 so in a passage quoted in Oxf. Dict. :
‘⁴ hvert hross skal 1 10115 skjota sara, er seli ei5a sabuli hefir 6, komit ;’'
01·. Ο. H. G. satulhms, sellariuS, equester (Gn-aff, Spr. IV, 1180).
1 see no chance 01· reconciling it with the obscure Ο. H. G. πεζήν,
sompes.

ᾗ 190. Επεὶ-1110 10 10 15 very puzzling. If it be a synonym of
sonis-tha, one would be tempted to read ebuis-the, a herd of 1101505,
formed like Ο. Η. G. awirt, emis-t, owzlet, sheep pen (cf. Goth.
awti-tr). That the ending st signifies not only a place but by
amplification the herd itself, appears from sonis-ta. Or should we
read watche = wigche-sonirtha, i. e. “a sonista 01· 1101505 ” (wiggi,
Ο. S. ποίεε, Α. S. waltge, Ο. N. vagg-fi

§191. For mar-tbi in 1, which has been rendered by “equa
praegnans ’', we should read marchi (?), O. N. men', mer-r, D.
mem‘e, O. H. G. merka, merke, a mare, though we would rather
expect mar-idm or marcha. Anciaca in 2 is nothing; a femin.
hungis-ta is possible, but unknown. It is perhaps a misplaced
Iungis-ta, a dative masc. Likewise misplaced is sunnazvta in ᾖ 6 01·
1110 same cod.

· ᾖ 192. Smhchatb in 6 should be ,τεαῖσι-1110 ,· likewise the Frenchi-
fied estalathia and other slight corruptions in 10. By comparing
Tit. IX, where 6 shows stallachia, and 10 stalacka as the Malb. to
‘⁴ animal aut caballus aut iumentum ’'‚ we obtain the result that the

term, which originally was clearly an adjective, does not exclusively.

mean a mare, but answers pretty nearly to Ο. Η. G. stalfelto,
iumenta (Graff, Spr. ΠΙ, 450). The difference will consist in the
fem. sing. serving to signify a mare, a iumenta, as we here and
there meet with in the Lex, whereas the neuter plural is the equiva-
lent 01· 1110 Latin plur. iumenta. The nomin. sing. fem. and nomin.
plur. neut. most probably were outwardly alike, as in Ο. H. G.
That in καὶαι-11111, stallae-hia the ending answers to an Ο. Η. G. iu
is not so strange, because the neuter pl. in Ο. S. ends in a, so that
the Frank. ia forms the link between iu and a (¹). Along with ia,
however, iu or io must have existed in the language 01· 1110 period,
for the corrupted sitabaim in 7, situbakim in 8, sithabakun, sitlea-
bahim in 9 unmistakeably point to stalahiu (²). It may be that
statas-haia in 6, where the accusat. fem. sing. is meant, should be
corrected into παίω-110, and that ia must be regarded as a later
addition by 000 who confounded it with the neuter pl. stalachia.

An interesting variant is hidden in Malb. thmdz'lzgia 01· 8, trach-
lagt'a 01· 7, 9 in Tit. IX. Tr, thr, is an inverted rt, rth, or what
appeared to be so in the eyes of the copyist 01· 1110 parent cod. of 7-9.
Not rt but st was meant. Τ110 restored reading is stadilagia, stha-
diligia. Stadilag, stadilig is derived from stadil, in the same way
as stalag, stallzjg from εἰσί. Βο111 mean the same thing. Stadii is
a variety 01· stadal, Ο, H. G. stadal‚ A. S. stassol, Ο. Fris. stathul,
Ο. S. nadal, statio.

ᾗ 193. For a soal cod. 1 has mar-solem, read marfolen, a nomin.
or accus. nent. or marsolene in the dative case. It is literally D.
mem‘eveulen, i. e. a filly ; cf. Ο. H. G. solo and fidi, siclin,
N. H. G. solen aud fi'c'llen, Goth. fiala, Ο. N. soli and syll.
Nabotlae in 6 is unmistakeably connected with nabahot in 7 and 9,
whereas napondero in 6, which seems to be a synonym 01· naboth,
agrees with the Malb. napodero in 10. Naboht (written naboth),
nabahot, contains apparently the diminutive suffix -t, like flebit, fiht

(²) If the adjective be a stem in 1· or fa, the accus. sing. fem. and nom. pl.

nent. will be ποῖαι-Μὴ ,· cf. Ο. S. εσδηία, Hel. 109, 0ος sumta, 115, 22.
(⁸) The expansion 01· sta into ma is dne to the Gallo-romanco speaking

scribes not being able to pronounce st ‚· another way of avoiding the nexus is
the prefixing of e, as in estalatlnu of 10.

(cf. Notes to Tit. 11), E. colt, rabbit‚ etc. Na may be D. na, aster,
following, near; O. S. na in nabar (Heyne, Kl. D. 158), D.
‚sabasam Ο. H. G. nala (0000 also na). At all events we must
suppose that na was interpreted in this sense, because in the next
ξ we find the Latin “poletrus sequens '' at nez-re. Both the
radical part 01· 1110 word boh and its relationship are unknown,
though it reminds us 01· Westphalian page, a horse (01·. Grimm,
G. D. S. 22), and, in sound, 01· Μ. D. baggele, a pig, farrow (see
Kil. i. v.). Napondero raises even more 000511οο5. We have seen
that the apocryphal pondero, podera in Tit. ΠΙ does not mean
“ poledrus,’' though the copyists may have sancied so, butan animal

ψ 01· 1110 bovine race, a cow. How, then, can it occur here to denote

a certain kind 01· horse? To remove the difficulty we must suppose
that there existed a comprehensive term which included any beast
01· burden, like A. S. woruf, weomf, vcors, pecuS, iumentum,
05011115. Now, O. H. G. hrind, the very word we would have
expected in Tit. ΙΙ, is rendered by “ bos, armentum ’⁹ and
“iumentum ” (s. Graff, Spr. IV, 1171). This fact is apt to con-
firm us in our suspicion that for pondem, podem, pmtero, etc„ in
Tit. H we have to read rondero, rodere, λιν-0111011». Nanmder(0),
nar-adedo), is exactly ‘⁴ sequens iumentum.'’

ξ 194. Uuadredo‚ uuadreto, uuadretho denotes, in ἦ 4 01· codd.
7-9 and the corresponding ξ 01· 10, a puledrus ,· but as we have met
before with the very same word indicating a stallion, we must
presume that the original reading has become obscured, either by
the mistakes or by the assimilating propensities 01· 1110 scribes.
Thus as it stands wadreth, ·redo, or rather mazar-etho, resembles
very much the Low German uelthpereth, iumentum, mentioned by
Graff, Spr. 111, 347, where we may also compare· pare-fret, pher-
frit, plurfiid, pherit, paredrus, vilis equus, paledrus (read pule-
drus(?) cs. 346).

ᾗ 195. Nare is an alteration 01· mare = marlae, 0. H. G. marla,
iumenta, a mare. It ought to stand where 1 has marthi. The
word ‘⁴ sequens ” (na) probably led the revisers 10 remove it to its
present place.

ᾖ 196. For aristo in 6 (the same cod. which before showed chan-
zoch‘o and chamis-to) we must read hangisto. The variant has at
least the value 01· proving that the ck was sounded in such a way as
to be easily dropt in pronunciatiom this can only be said 01· 1110
500οἀ of Ιι, never of ch.

ᾖ 197. In andeabimr 01· 6, andechobina 01· 10, habim = chabina
cannot be habeta, the laming, crippling, known from Tit. XXIX,
because ande would, in such a case, be meaningless. Therefore
ltabina, chabina (bovina), with short a, is intended. Andehabina
or haudehabina means “ maintenance, medical treatment, cure ”;
cf. Tit. XVII. The real purport of the term is, οο doubt, to indi-
cate that besides the fine an extra sum had to be paid to the owner
01· 1110 disabled animal, by striking or otherwise. It is extremely
nnlikely that such a small sum as we find mentioned in this para·
graph would have been considered an adequate indemnification to
the proprietor 01· a stallion who had sustained a loss in his usual
income by the horse having been castrated. The Malb. most
probably belonged originally to ξ 9 and ξ 13 (01· cod. 6) likewise,
though the compilers of the text 01· 6-10 111011οᾰ 1110 payment to
the extra sum 01· 1 trians 101 each mare, to which the corrector in
10 adds: ‘⁶ quod ille inire consueverat ’' and in Lex Emend.
“ quam continere consueverat.” The absurdity 01· such phrases,
without any limitation as to the period the stallion had been in use,
sufficiently indicates that the original law contained nothing of this
show 01· 10ἱο0100055 in the Latin textS.
