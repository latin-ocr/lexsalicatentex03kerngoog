INTRODUCTION.

Pardessus as not to be found; see below, col. xxii), 4⁰, 9th or 10111
00111., b) Vatican Christin„ 846, 40. According to Pardessus (Pref.
L) the latter MS. has aster the edict 01· Childebert of 596: “ Anno
feliciter undecimo regni domni Caroli gloriosissimi 10313, mense
martio,” i. e. circa A· 1). 779, as the title of emperor is not given to
Charlemagne.

Τ110 MSS. of this Family contain a text resembling that of the
Second Family and the Lex Emendata, but divided systematically
into99 (the St. Gallen MS. '731 1133 100) chapterS. This Family is to
be divided into two subdivisionS. The codd. of the first division
contain the so-called Malberg Glosses, which are omitted in the
MSS. of the second division. The text 01· 1110 latter division
differs moreover from that of the first in that it bears traces of
attempts to make the language more concise, while in several places
it approaches the text of the Lex Emendate. These differenceS,
however, were not substantial enough to justify the text being
treated separately in the present work. Hence the various readings
have been given in notes to the text of the first division, for which
cod. 7 has been taken as the basis, One important difference be-
tween the two classes is that the MSS. of the first division contain
the whole chapter 99 De careum-uda, in terms analogous to those
of the First and Second Family, with the addition in the rubric
“quod paganorum tempus observabant,” while the MSS. of the
second division say 01· this custom: ‘⁴ De chrmecruta lege quae
paganorum tempore observabant deinceps nunquam valeat, quia per
ipsam cecidit multorum potestas-'¹

We have no evidence as to the time this redaction was made, or
the motives for such 3 complete alteration in the numbering and
classifimtion of the chapters. But Pardessus (Loi Salique, p. 115)
calls attention to a short announcement which occurs in the Mont-
pellier MS. at the end of the Prologue Ι, immediately before the
table of rubrica which precedes the text of the lex Salia-a : “ Anno
ter XIII decimo regnante domno nostro Pipino gloriosissimo rege
Francormn.” As the MS. contains documents posterior to the
reign of Pepin, the object 01· 11113 announcement could not be to in-
dicate the time the MS. was copied. 11 may, therefore, be supposed
that it must refer 10 1110 111110 when the document itself, to which it

is joined, was composed, and that this redaction of the Salic Law
was made by order of Pepin.
