NOTES. TIT. VI.

and 2, the others have committed several blunderS‚ such as can only
be explained by the supposition that the revisers of the later texts of
the Lex used corrupted F rankish texts os the Malberg; and, partly
on account of the bad condition of their materials, partly from
ignorance, have brought about a state of hopeless confusion, an
assertion which 1 will endeavour to prove.

ᾗ 5 ῐ. The stealing or killing osa “ sigusius magister ”is punishable
with 600d., according to the undoubtedly correct reading in codd.
ι, 2, 3 and 10. But in the Lex Emend. we find the same delict
fined with 1800d. The origin os this alteration can be traced back
to ἦ 2 in cod. 10, where the same amount of fine is given. This
unwarranted change arose, in my opinion, from the Malberg tue ne
chunne in 10, which the reviset understood to mean tue neun channe
(chunna), twice nine hundred. Indeed, the sound of this term
resembles theuue ne (read tune neun) chunna (i. e. 2 κ 900) in the
Chunnas, and the expression “two nine’' or “twice nine'’ must
have been as common in the sorensic language of the Franks as
tzoia niugun (i. e. 18) in that os the Frisians; cf. Fris. LL. p. 120,
where nm‘a niugun skille'nga occurs no less than three times in one
column. It is therefore perfectly natural that the reviser saw in
the term the expression for 1800. Yet, on consulting the other
codices, we perceive that his interpretation was wrong, sor it is pal-
pable that tueneclzunne, whatever may be its real meaning and
original reading, is but a slight variation os tuneclumna in 8, tune-
chana in 7, tinechana in 9, and must even be somehow related to
the syllables tohenlzunni in b. Now, there is no question os any-
thing like 1800 in these four codd„ all os which distinctly give a fine
of 6ood. Consequently, the socalled gloss means something
different, but what ? Ι think, we have to read taine-chunna, ttine-
chunne, a dative os tanea-huma, i. e. canis curtis. Tdne is the stem
of the common Teut. word, A. S. tan, domuS, vicuS, villa, septum,
E. town, Ο. N. tuin, a sarm-house, homestead, Frank. of the Psalms
tun, maceria, D. tuin, garden, etc. The dative chunna, channe is
probably due to the verb denoting stealing governing that case as
in Ο. N. stela. As to hunn (chunn) for hund, it suffices to remem-
ber the fact that in several Frankish, Saxon, and F risian dialects
the assimilation os nd to nn is quite common3 the modern Fris.
form of the word is huzon, North Fris. Ιιιῖη.

T uneclzunn is but one of several words denoting a “ canis custos
domus sive curtiS,'’ as the Lex Emend. puts it. It is not unlikely
that tuneckunn more particularly answers to “canis curtiS,’' whereas
another term obtained for “canis domus,” viz. cbuuscurru, chas-
com-u, which occurs. slightly corrupted, in 7, 8, 9. Curru, corru is
M. D. horre, canis domesticus (cf. Kil. i. v..) ; clauus i. e. luis needs
no comment. E. curis os course etymologically identical with M. D.
horre, Frank. curru, so that has-curru, literally translated, means
‘⁶ house cur.”

The question as to whether henhunniin 6 may be explained as a
synonym of huscurru and tunecltunn seems to me capable of being
answered in the affirmative, for hen may very well stand sor hegn,
D. heinz'ng, which means exactly the same as H. G. saun. Hence
Itenhunn would be virtually the same as tunechunn. There is no
cogent reason for reading he'mhunn, though 1 must add that in the
N. Saxon dialect of Drente the ‘⁸ canis curtis ” is called heemhond.

ᾗ 52. The Malberg of this Title contains as yet no trace whatsoever
of the “ sigusius '' (¹) ; all the terms treated of refer to a ‘⁴ canis domus

,(ῑ) N aturally so, for the Frank.te'rm itself is sak-usi, scusi, which appears but
slightly disguised in its Latin garb.

sive curtis,” the stealing or killing of which is punishable with as
high a fine as that of a ‘⁶ sigusius.” The equality os the fine is the
cause os the terms for a housedog and all other dogs having been
put together. Indeed, cod. 1 shows only leudardi once in the whole
Tit. ; this is also found in 2, but, as we shall see afterwardS, in the
wrong place. Before proceeding, however, to show this, we have
to occupy ourselves with troilo in ὁ, fhuuuic in 7, fluuuicus in 8,
phuuuic in 9, trociuuithier in 10. After removing some palpable
errors, these glosses represent: tr0(w)it(t)o, thruwithw), tmchwithz'.
Thr-1⁴02), tru(lz), throch, ποθι), etc„ agree with O. S. (hak)-thru(h),
boia, in Gl. Prud. 190 and 4¹95 Ο. Η. G. truh, drulc (thr-uh), etc.
pedica, compes; halstrulz,halsdruh, etc. baga, boia (cl. Graff, Spr.
V, 254, sq.) (¹). Wem, weihtke in O. Fris. is ‘⁸ a strap, a halter” ;
A. S. τοίδδε “restiS‚ loramentum.‘' From a compound θεωρη-
witta, tmchwz'ttha, etc. we get a derivative adj. thru(h)wimb. etc.
(cs. O. S. anter-mdia, Gl. Prud. 573), the sense of which must be
“having a thrulz as a setter ” or ‘⁶ being bound to a thruh.” It is
curious to see how the Frank translators have rendered thrub-
witt0. They wholly misunderstood witto (notwithstanding that some
codices must have had wiethie, as we learn srom ιο), and derived it
srorn witan, to know. Hence their quasi accurate rendering :
‘⁶ canis qui ligamen novit ’' Ξ It is but just to observe that we are
under some obligation to this odd translation, as it confirms the
readings which we have arrived at by a comparison of the codices.
It will be understood that the readings proposed above make no
pretension to being more than approximately correct. Thus it may
be that in 10 the true reading is trochwittln'es chunnis, i. e. a geni-⁴
tive case, governed by some substantive denoting stealing or killing.

ᾧ 53. The delicts specified in the two §§ os cod. 1 are punishable,
the first with a fine os 600d., the other with one of 120d. It has
already been observed that cod. 2 repeats the term leodardi ; but as
it indicates a fine osssood. it has got, the second time, into the wrong
place, sor it ought to stand as Malb. to ‘⁶ sicut superius‚'' and should
not be connected with 120d. Cod. 10 commits the same error, and
7-9 make another mistake in that they separate leodardi from the
words denoting the ‘⁴ canis domus sive curtis,” the stealing or killing
os which is punished by the fine called leodardi. From 10 we learn
that an equivalent os leodardi (²) is theoprano. This evidently
means the same as theofoano in 6, which again cannot be
separated from chunommo in 7, 9, chunabana in 8, nor from theo-
phano and chunnouano in 10, hunuane in 6. Is we bear in mind
that the letters f (pla), b, i. e. δ, and v, written u, as medials are
interchangeable, and moreover that t and c are constantly conlused
with each other, we may feel satisfied that all these readings must
originally have meant the same. They may be corrected into cheo
(or clze) ofano, chun' (or chwiu) ovano (obana) (or chuu abana),
chwi ovano, hwi omne (or hwiu ovone). Cheo (or perhaps che)
stands sor chweo, like O. H. G. hiu sor hwite, D. lwe, sor hmo&
zoet sor zwoet: N. H. G. su'sz for swu''s2; O. N. hjdc sor boiol,- O.
Fris. hat, N. Fris. het for hwat; E. who, in sound. Clu-0, as well
as chwi, or cha, chuia, etc.. answer to O. S. bueo (Heliand, 142, 8),
