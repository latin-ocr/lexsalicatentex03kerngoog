NOTES. TITT. LVIII. LXI. LXIII. LXIV.

By preferring the reading chrmechrudw) we gain the additional ad-
vantage that the term may be explained as a quibble3 for though
with ns quibbles are only acconnted as elements of wit, in ancient
times they were considered to be essential to the display of profound
wisdom. As chama) belongs to the same root as the O. N. verb
hry'ofia, to clear, Dan. rydde, to weed, clear, N. H. G. rente, a mat-
tock‚ reaten, to weed, the compound cmlxv-adm) might be under-
stood as conveying the meaning of “dean-xiddance.” Not impos·
sible, though somewhat more strained, would be the same quibble in
the form chrmecruda ; sor since crrid means a weed‚ a derivative
cn2da may have been taken in the sense of a weeding‚ a clearing. It
is obvious that the quibble can be admissible only on condition that
crud, like chrdd, combined the notions os grit, rubbish, dust, and a
clearing. Now D. kruid not only means “herba,” but also “ gun-
powder,’' and Ι see no reason why mad should not have denoted
powder already with the Franks; an analogous connexion exists
between the two meanings of D. suff, viz. dust and stuff.

Along with chrud and crud we meet with a third variety, namely,
curando, which occurs once in the 5th section of 2. I guess that
grand is meant (¹). The final oin the supposed grando would be
the sign os the dative of a stem in u (cf. Goth. grundis-vaddjus).

The variant chruta in cod. B (column of 7-9) recalls M. D.
⁴g'rm'te, E. grit and groats ,· the monstrous chrucx in cod. F bears
a strong, albeit perhaps an accidental, resemblance to D. gruis,
gravei, grit, rubbish, dust.

In 3 we find consistently written chemcncda. We could not
think of taking chem for a mere corruption of ebreus. Cheru looks
like a fem. subst., or could it be the obscure hera in O. H. G. hera-
pas, mediocris, parvus (Grais, Spr. IV, 1015)? A gloss in some
MSS. of the Lex Em. explains clarenechrudm) by ‘⁸ terra mala,’'
from which we may infer that chrene was taken by the interpreter
in the sense not os E. clean, but of D. and G. blein, parvus, tenuis,
which approaches ‘⁴ mala terra ” near enough. Though the inter-
pretation is wrong, it could hardly be called fanciful.

ᾗ 257. Duropal, duropell, durpil, dorpil is the D. dorpel, a
threshold‚ Ο. Fris. dreppel‚ drepl, from *dun dum, Goth. daur,
etc., adoor, and*pal‚.,Dpaal O. Fris. pel,.O H. Gwphal etc.,

‘a pile, pale’' (cf. Grimm, D. G. ΠΙ, 432). For the custom of
swearingan oath on the threshold, cf. Grimm, R. A. 904.

LXI.

ᾗ 2 58. Char-aena, better (tharvenna, hermena, harawano (Tit.
XVII), etc., is a derivative from a verb answering to E. ω hamw,
A. S. hermian, heman, hymian, hyrwan, vexare ; Ο. Η. G. ham-
mn, hermen, exasperare. Closely connected is E. to hany, A. S.
hen‘an, hergr'an, vastare, Ο. Η. G. harjdn, hery'dn, berron, vastare,
praedare, Ο. N. hery'a, so that in point of fact the Frank. term may
be called the counterpart of Ο. N. hemabr, fiemosr, a harrying,
plundering (e. g. Gragas 2, 134, sqq.>. How denominative verbs in
wan (m'an, wen) and ian may alternate is exemplified by A. S.
ken'an, herigean, vexare, also being used in the sense os Ityrwian,
aspernari, conviciare, blasphemare in Caedmon's Genesis 2238 and
Elene 920. In the same way A. S. bescnwan and bescm'an both

mean “privare3 ‘⁹ and again tyr-mian == tynum arrigat: (Ettm. Lex.

(²) If giht-und in Heliand 75, ar were above suspicion we might even

{hink of mna. But as matters stand, it is safer not to appeal to that strange

522). The form chenne in 10 (Tit. XVII) is directly derived from
cher-ehu, i. e. A. S. henan, Ο. H. G. bersum E. to har-ry.

The ending a, o is undoubtedly that of a dat. instrum. governed
by the preposition, but it is not so easy to decide whether the word
be a fem. nom. act. in nt'a, or a gerund. In the latter case, nna,
nno, na, no would answer to O. S. nnea, nna, nne, A. S. nne, e. g.
5⁶ segestam, te ίόξεαηηα, tesaranne, M. D. te aggeus, te negem,
te wrme. That in rubrics both the gerund and a nom. act. were
used may be inserted from those of Tit. I de manm're and Tit.
XLVI de adsatlaeamire, etc., along with de affatomiae. Caroea
(read charoen) in 4 proves nothing. As regards the Malb. it is
safer to take the term sor a dat. of a fem. nom. actionis.

§259. alchana in 1 I am unable to explain. I guess that we
must read fulchoni, ‘⁸ for a robbing.”

LXIII.

§ 260. Leodardr, leudardi in 2 and ιο is here unequivocally syno-
nymous with leude in 1. It is an analogous case when in A. S.
leddgeld and manwyro are used promiscuously with ledda. In the
Fris. LL. 446, 24 also we find luidwerdene used contrary to its
ordinary meaning as a synonym of weregild: “ jefma an man slaith
jefta stath, is hi al daed, soe scelma hem beta mit en luydwerdene.”
1t should be observed that the fixed number, viz. 600, occurs here
as well as in the numerous other cases where leodardi is mentioned,
though there denarii are understood, whereas here as many solidi
are required.

Leudardi trespellia (read threspellia) is the Frankish for “ triplex
compositio-” nrapelh'a, better thnltpellia, is the strong accus.
sing. fem. of the adj. thr-apelli, threefold; formed like O. H. G.
zwispild, double. The ll where 0. H. G. shows ld is analogous to
ll in Ο. N. spilla, D. spillen, to spoil, squander, contrasted with
Ο. Η. G. spadam effundere; cf. also Ο. N. φᾶ, a tablet, alternat-
ing with spaldi, Goth. spilda. For another Latinized tre-spellius, s.
Tit. 111.

For motherin 1 read morther or mor-thes ; cf. Tit. LV, ξ 245.

LXIV.

ᾦ 261. Hereburgi, her-burgi, herborgi, etc., is a term the exact
purport of which was unknown even to the arrangers or translators
of the Lex. They left us the choice between two paraphrases, viz.
“ strioportio,” whatever that may be, and ‘⁴ qui aeneum portare dici-
tur ubi striae coquinant.'’ Here, heris clearly O. N. herr, in the
sense of “ the evil host, the fiends; ” whence herkerling, a hag;
heristi, a monster. Just as by the side os herkerling we find in
O. N. hery'ans-kerling, a hag, so we see in 10 chemioburg, the for-
mer part of which (be it either cheruio or chet-nio or cher-ino) shows
a derivative from here, analogous to Ο. N. kerfizn, the devi1; cf. E,
old Har-ty. Considering that the term intended in 2 is harbaro—
which the scribe metamorphosed into a nice Latin barbaro—we may
render the latter part of the compound, burgi = bara, by “ a sup-
porter, ’' and the whole term by “ a devil-supporter, a harbourer of
fiendsss’ Harbaro reminds us of Ο. N. Harbars, as Wodan is
called' m the Edda; how one and the same word applies to Wodan
as well as to the Devil 1s exemplified by Ο. N. herjcm

Grimm, R. A. 645, prefers the other paraphrase, and would
change chemioburg into chuerioburg. 1t seems to me that such
an eclecticism should not be resorted to, when there is no reason
to distrust the reading of the MSS.
