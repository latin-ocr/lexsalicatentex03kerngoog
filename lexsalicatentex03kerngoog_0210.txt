fusion both in the text and the appended Malberg. They are
absent from-the older codd„ 3 circumstance which must raise doubt
as to whether those paragraphs are based upon the original law.
We may go further and assert without rashness that anything
relating to presbyten, deacons 3ηά bishops in 7-9 and Lex Emend.
is unquestionably a later addition. How could the law os the heathen
Franks contain provisions of the kind? At the very earliest these
additions can only date from the latter half os the reign of Chlowis.

in modum basilicae factus super hominem mortuum.'’ This phrase
points to a dome-like 01 bell-shaped shrine containing a relic,

holy gravemounds, date from times immemor-ial-

tarsz'no has the appearance os being 3 dative or genit. case of
a nom. act. answering to spoliatio. I derive it from tar-sian or
tam'aem, Ο. H. G. nemim (rather zerrjan, praeter. rane), to tear,
Ο. Ν. tam, term, to stretch; from the same radical asA. S. ter-an,
rumpere, scindere; O. H. G. seran, destruere; A. S. atemn, diri-
pere ; geteorung, deliquium3 tergun, yergua, etc., D. tergen, vexare,
irritare3 N. Η. G. sergeri ,· connected also is Ο. H. G. som, A. S.
torn, D. toom, ira, but 0. Η. G. also “contumelia, incendium: ”
Goth. gataur-ps, καθαίρεσις. 13 short tar-sina or tarr-ina means
spoiling, undoing, violation, profanation. The former part of the
compound has been tampered with, and shows in 10 traces of
an attempt to mix up various tenus. Chreot by the side
of cliro in 7·9 points to clarat, Goth. brat, στέγη, Rima, Ο. N.
hrot. Considering the use of the synonymous A. S. laras, sum-
mum, cacumen, we may ascribe to chrrit the meaning of a dome,
3 vault. Clamo in 6 is not clean it may be the same as cheri,
(Mari in the word chertrtaduna treated in ᾇ 247, for the stem haria
may become cher-122, clamo ; cf. chariocheeto in Tit. III. Yet the
arranger or translator os the Lex seems to have taken it for a geni-
tive plural, as he renders it by “ basilicas ”3 not unlikely he saw in
it chere(h) = A. S. herig, 3 vicarious form osbearg (3. Grein, Gloss.
i. v. hear-g), Ο. Η. G. har-ug, O. N. luirg. ‘⁴ In provincial Norse 3
dome-shaped mountain is called horg,” says the Oxf. Dict. i. v.
ᾗόν-εν· ,· 3ηά 11 3130 states that the hb'rgr was 33 31131 of stone, or a
sacrificial cairn, like kaugr, built in open air. By this we may
account for the translation, though we have no means to make out
whether it is the right one, and the reading followed by 6 genuine.

It seems to me that either the same chemin, 01 otherwise
Ο. Η. G. heri (haer), sanctus, almus, occurs in 6 in the next
Malberg chenechruda, read cherechruda. Rada, rude in 10, rudua,
read radan in 7-9, is 3 substantive belonging 10 3 verb maon,
Ο. Fris. rada, to drag, pluck; Ο. Η. G. rdtdn, to destroy, blast,
as may be inferred from the phrase al rdtdntemo nordwinde, saevis
aquilonibus. Ruda is pretty much the same as tarsina, but as

0. N. ryt5ja means to clear (e. g. awood by buming), and also to
empty, to strip, and rysjask um, to make great havoc, it is readily
understood that the interpretem, rightly or not, made 3 distinction
between chem tarsina and cleemch mda.1n the Lex Em. the word
is not exclusively understood as meaning a burning, but applied also
to ‘⁸ expoliatio ” 3ηά “ aliquid tulerit.” The more usual word de-
noting all this is A. S. scr-iwan, diripere, vastare, also said of lire,
maenades& (cr. Greia, ffloss. i. ι), 0.H.G. mam, amm,
destruere. Alae, alut is decidedly wrong, but the true reading un-
certain. It may be alac- (i. e. alach or alag) καὶαπ (rude), 33 alah
is a common Teutonic word; to account for the t both in 7-9 3ηά
10 we might suppose that it is a remnant of alastrude, i. e. clava)-
stmde. We might even propose other changes to obtain something
plausible; but the Malb. as it stands is meaningless. Nor is theo-
tidio in 10 clear. Ii'dio, apparently a dative, or perhaps the nomi-
native of a femin. stem in ia, reminds us os the M. D. verb tuden, O.
Fris. tram, which means to drag, trail, and is therefore synonymous
with G. serv-en, French τίνα’. Ι 333 no objection to take this ἡὶίἰα
33 coinciding with, or 3 variant of, rada, and terrina. The genuine
reading os the Malb. teonine, martine, and teorgr’ae, theorgiae,
theorgr‘e in 7-9, is so uncertain that 1 abstain from attempting any
explanation.

ἦ 2 54. For lampio-ii, in the last section of cod. 1, 1 propose to md
samph'cu, i. e. “ the being 33 accomplice, accessariness,’‘ the D.
term being medeplrkhtigheid, from medeplichtig, M. D. also med-
plichtig, accessary. The radical part is in both words the same,
while mede, med, “ cum,'’ is synonymous with Ο. N. and A. S. sam in
a variety os words, Ο. Η. G. sam in summist--mitiwist‚ consortium
(cf. Grimm, D. G. ΙΙ, 764, sq.). According to this explanation
samplz'cti or samplz‘cti would denote ι “ for accessariness.”

schot, contribution, A. S. scot (an 'alote et an scote, LL. Will. 3, 4),
E. scot, M. D. schot. In a charter of Α. D. 896 occurs the D. gr-
scot .· ‘⁴ in ripis Dorestado, ut nec bannum, nec fredum, nec coniec-
tum quod ab ipsis gis-cot vocaturn esse comperimus, contingere aut
exactare presumeret ” (Sloet‚ Oork. No. 69).

ξ 356. Chr-enema, etc„ has been treated by Grimm in R. A.
1 11, sqq. He connects the term with the herba pura of the
Romans, and points out the close similarity between the collecting
the earth from the four corners of the hearth, as prescribed in the
Norwegiau Gulapings Law, and the statement couched in the
words: “ de quatuor angulis terra 3 pulverem in pugno colligere ”
(l. 3. 117). He analyses the term into clarem, Goth. braim, pure,
Ο. S. hreni, etc., and criu, weed, Ο. S. crdd, M. D. cruud, N. D.
kmid, etc.

Grimm’s explanation is in my opinion right, at least in the main.
Still there are difficulties which ought to be cleared away and not to
be ignored. In the first place it must be acknowledged that the read·
ing chrud 13, 10 say the least, as well supported as crud. 1 believe
