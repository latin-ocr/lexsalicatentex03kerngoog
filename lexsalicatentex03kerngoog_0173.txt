NOTES. TITT. XIV. XV. XVI.

ancient Teutonic word for ‘⁸ a corpse ’³ ς 0. S. hren, hrio, etc„ still
extant in D. reeuw and reeroos,· Fris, renis, rimif; cf. Grimm,
R. A. 635. It is strange that the term for ‘⁸ spoliatio mortui,” used
in the Netherlands as well as in Lombardy, does not appear in the
Lex Salica, and that we find instead chreomurdio. What the
Norsemen understood by the mor& of a corpse we have seen in a
passage from the Volsunga Saga, quoted in ᾇ 86. The clandestine
character of mur-dio is emphasized by the words “ in furtum.'’ We
have no means to decide whether ‘⁶ spoliatio ’⁹ is essential to the
crime termed mur-dio„ At any rate, chreomurdf'o cannot refer to
“ hominem domientem spoliare ”3 the gloss is misplaced, and, in
my opinion, mistranslated. As to “ mortui spoliatio,” this is
called noreb’r in 2. It may, possibly, seem bold to guess that here
we have the very (h)reort5b, mixed up, perhaps, with ηὸνὸῠς but when
we have regard to the corruption of rhairaub, in the Longobardian
Law, into vmbhi, (ε. Graff, Spr. H, 358) our guess will not seem im·
probable. Νόνόὂ would also be appropriate because no answers to
Goth. naus, O.N. πάν, etc„ “a corpse.”

ἑ 91. For tur-nicole, etc„ in 2 (col. 83) Ι refer to Tit. LV, as well
as sor hidulgus, etc„ in 7, 8, 9, 10. One gloss is lest to be explained,
viz. sec-this in ἦ 6 of 1. We have to read secthis (pron. sechtir),
“ os fighting.” The notion expressed by “ villam alienam adsalire ”
iS, is we take ‘⁶ villa ” in the sense os a farm, not different from
what otherwise is called in A. S. hdmsdcn, O. Fris. kemsekahge.
Now we find in the LL. F ris„ p. 230, that the very word kemse-
kinge is rendered in the Low German paraphrase by besechtinge,
radically the same as fectlu'. Another proof that fechtae‘, identical
in every respect with A. S. filit, was synonymous with kdmsdcn, is
a passage in the Leges Henrici 1 <Schmid, Ges. d. Aug„ p. 478)
running thus: “Infilzt vel ziasocna est, quod ab ipsis qui in domo
sunt contubernales agitur.” Hdmsb'cn and sechti (fiht) being
‘⁴ invasio domus alienae,” it follows that infiht, owing to the pre-
fixed in, denotes as it were “ invasio interna,’' or if we prefer
it, “internal fighting.” Fechtis is the gen. sg.

ᾧ 92. Affalthecka in 2 should be affatthecha, better spelt affat-
techa, the nomen action. of a verb affatteclzan (A. S. seugean) =
affattian, effatam (A. S. fetian), O. Η. G. saszbn, sazbn, abducere,
to take away. It is a derivative of the same kind as texeclta,
hatega (Gl. L. 551), tiloga (Ps. 54, 3), and, except the difference in
gender, Ο. Fris. tichtega, accusatio.

ᾗ 93. A word of similar formation is obliga, bad spelling for afliga,
in 6; sor abteca, abthega, ablica, in 7, 8, 9, 10, read abtega, abnga.
It is a variation of Ο. Fris. astinga, the taking to wife, from affigia,
Low German echi-lgm, in matrimonium ducere.

There can be no reasonable doubt that astiga was a common
Frank. word, though it may be questioned whether it be the
original reading. This is probably not the case, as no term sor
‘⁸ taking to wife '’ is here required, but one sor “ taking away a
wife.” In short, abtiga is a good word, but a bad variant for
abswga. Some revisers os the Lex seem themselves to have felt
that a term for ‘⁶ taking to wife ’⁹ was not suitable here; they added,
therefore, another expression from other books or whatever material
they had at their disposal, and hence their in alia mente, French autre-
ment. The addition of this second term must have taken place long
before the time when our codd. 7-10 were written, sor it appears in
them in a much altered shape. Cod. 7 has abhatto ueelentemo, 9
abhacto uelenthemo, 8 abbata uelentemo, ιο arbathe usenzanthamo.
From 10 Ι gather that here also different readings are mixed together.

To begin with the last word, it would seem that some MSS. had
wesanthamo, others leventhemo, viventi. Both, of course, repre-
sent a dat. sing. of a pr'es. partic.) wesanthamo -- Goth. wisan-
damma, O. H. G. wesantemO, etc.; leventhemo ε Ο. Η. G. leben-
demo (lebentemo). The nth in the part„ where Goth. and A. S.
have nd, agrees with the usual writinginthe Gl. Prud.: wemmanthi
3713 rethinanthemo 2885 undarwerpanthi 39ι; ΙινίταητΙιίοη 327,
etc. That wesan was used in the sense os “ being still alive,” and
in so far synonymously with leven, Ο. 1-1. G. leben, etc„ appears from
some passages in the Frisian Laws and the Gragas3 ε. g. LL.
Fris. p. 410: “Na sehilmase da mssgem dela3 nd scil di broder
habba een pond jes hi deer is (i. e. is he be stin alive); ende jes hi
decr naet is, so aegh hit to nimen sines broders soen.” In Gragas,
I, p. 305 (ed. of 1829), one cod. has: “Nu lifir eigi molvir, pa
scal systir samsepra ef hon a boanda,” the other: “Nu er eigi
mopir, lta a sa mapr er a systor hennar samsepra.”

Therefore abhacto, &c., as it stands, may be explained if we suppose
that hacto (pron. hachto), an instrum. case governed by ab ε af,
from, is taken in the concrete sense os husband, Ο. Fris. asteman
(but cf. Ο. S. antkehtz), though we can produce no example to show
that either hacht or synonymous words of similar sound with which
it is constantly confounded, such as kaft, acht (ast, eckt), occur in
this way. After all we must bear in mind that abhacto looks like a
conjecture for abfatto (affattio = affltteclea, or a verbal form cor·
responding to it). Arbathein rois decidedly wrong, read abfatlae,
which, in my opinion, is the temnant of abfatte, either a substan-
tive or a verbal form, but possibly understood by the reviser as ab
(af), from, and fache, Goth. sadi (in brdpsaps), Skr. patyd, Gr. πόσει,
marito, The uncertainty of the reading of 10 is increased by the
fact that in this cod. ht usually passes into th, just as in many
Frank. charters, in most of the documents osWerden, on the borders
os Franks and Saxons, and in Middle Frankish (Ripuarian) dia-
lects. 11· we knew sor certain that 7, 8, 9 offered an approximately
correct reading, we should then change arbathe into afhathe. The
case being otherwise, it is unsase to do so,

ᾗ 94. The Malb. leudardi in 1 isquite distinct from the terms in the
other codd., which point more or less to one common bad source.
What this well-known word here means is sully illustrated by the
Fris, LL., from which we learn that liudwerdene (al. liudwed,
wetma, ury‘dd, jeld) is a particular pecuniary satisfaction, amends.
In these Laws, ch. 74-77, w'e read in the Latin version: “tunc
debet ille vitam duplici emenda emendare et illi matronae liud·
wirdene”; the original texts have (a): “sa scel hi thet lif tui-
salda jelde jelda and liudwed mith tuelef merkum te jeldane '’;
(c): ‘⁴ thet jeld and there liodawed alsa hAge alsa tha liode loviat‚
and thet urjeld bi twilif merkon, and there wive hiri liodwerdene
mith twilif merkon to sellande”; the Saxon text reads: “ so sal
he dat lijf dubbelt betalen ende der vrouwen eer luydweerde mit
12 marke vorvullen.”

In saying that the Malb. in 1 is radicauy different from those in
all the other codd. 1 do not imply that there is any conflict between
leudardi on one side, and affattecha, etc„ on the other. The
former indicates the penalty, the latter the offence. ΤΙιε con-
clusions to be drawn from the appearance of discrepancies of such
a kind may be left to the reader-

ᾗ 95. Αζίατῆἰο in 1 requires correction which, fortunately, is
suggested by altha-'firmio in § 2 of the same codex, though even this
is not wholly correct. From the Latin words ‘⁸ casa, cletem,
