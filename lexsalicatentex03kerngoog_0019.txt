INTRODUCTION.

subjects (see the Capit‘. of 803), but Eginhard (Vna Kasoli Magni,
cap. 29) says: pauca capitula, et ea imperfecta legibus addidit.

The MSS. os the L. Em. contain a text of 7ο chapters, the
first entitled: De mannire, the last: De eo qui filiam alt'enam
&c. But it has already been remarked above that one Ms„
Paris 4632, adds two more chapterS, the one entitled: De
term condenmata (also occuning in the MSS. of the Third Family,
and in Herold‚ though with an entirely different bearing), the
other: De :bavai-tu stul-to, The index os the MS„ however, re-
cords only 70 chapterS. One other MS„ Wolfenbiittel 5ο, 2. Aug.
8, adds the chapter De invitus 1πῖτο to *the 70 usual chapters..
These additional chapters will be found among the (capita) Extra-
vaganu‘a. It is clear from the Capitulary os 819 (see ool. 419 of
the present work) that the order of the chapters of the L. Em. must
have been as we possess it from the beginning of its compilation.

In comparing the 70 chapters of the L. Em. with the 65 chap-
ters of the earliest redaction, it will be seen that only the three
chapters LVIII, LXIX and LXX have been added to the L. Em.
(cs. above the note on col. xiv).

The MSS. 4628Α, 4631, 4760 and 10758 contain what may be
called a general table of contents (p. 58 of 10758, cf. PardessuS,
Loi Sal„ p. 275): Incipiunt libelli uel decretio (decreti, 4628A)
Chlodeueo et childeberto, siue Chlothario et Karolo fuit lucide
emendatum. Ι. De legibus diuinis et humaniS. 11. Pactus Chil-
deberti 10315, 111ᾶο 'sunt capitula XCVIII (XVIII, 4628A). 111.
Decretio chlotharii regis, cap. XVII, Lex Suanorum (cf. Mon.
Germ. Legg. 111. 14). IV. Decretum Childeberti regiS, de eo qui
hominem nobilem plagauerunt (plagauerit, 4628A). V. De reliquis
conditionibus, id sunt capitula XVII. VI. Decretio Karoli regis»,
cap. XVIII; memoratio de octo bannos», id sunt cap. XXIV
(XXXIV, 4628A), id sunt capitula VIII. VII. De septem sep-
tinas (septenniS, 4628Α), cap. XIX; , jussio domni (4628A adds:

, nostri) Kasoli3 inde sunt cap. VIII. VIII. Sciendum est quod in

quibusdam, id sunt capitula IV. IX. Decretum est ut qui in uigi-
lias qualiter ordinauit (ordinatum, 4628A) propter famis inopiam.
X. De tractatu legis Salicae. XI. Pro legis Salicae. XII. De

mat hominem, inde sunt cap. VI. XIV. De mannire, inde sunt
capitula LXX. XV. Lex Ribuariorum, inde sunt capitula XCI.
XVI. Lex Alamannorum. ,

Pardessus informs us that the MSS. 4760 and 107 58 do not con-
tain the Leges Rip, and Alam. The MSS. 4628A and 4631 (which
is a copy of the former) contain only the first nine documents.

lo. The text published by Herold in his Originum ac Germani-
carum Antiquitatum libri, Basil. 1557, fol. pp. 1—38. Third
Appendix os Pardessus‚ Merkel’s tenth text. Cf. Mon. Germ.
This version differs from all the others we know at present, and
no trace os the Fulda MS. which Herold used has hitherto been
found. That he had more than one MS. at his disposal is clear

from the various readings he gives in the margin, which differ not ⁴

only from Herold’s text itself, but also from all the other texts (cf.
tit. 11. 8 3 VI. 1 &c.). There is, therefore. reason to suppose that at
least two of the MSS. he used have been lost, unless we assume

with Grimm (Pres. LXXVI) that the marginal notes may also have
been in Herold’s MS.

Herold’s text has the appearance os being an amalgamation os
several versions. Occasionally we find in the same tit. repetitions of

paragraphs almost identical (cf. tit. XVII (XX). 1ος XIX (XXII).
ιδ. 3) ; in some chapters such expressions as: in alia mente (tit. 11.
193 XV; XXIII (XXVI). 1); in aliopacto (X (XI). 8);2·na12·a
sententia (XIV(XVII). 5) ; antiq-ua lege (LV (LVIII). lb). But it
is impossible to say whether Herold faithfully followed one MS„ or
whether he compiled his text from materials collected from various
MSS. On the title-page os bis work it is said : ‘⁸ . . . Opera B. J.
Herold, ac collatione exemplariorum quae vetustissimis necnon ante
septingentos annos depictis characteribus expressa erant, descripti,
emendati, atque in lucem magna religione editi.”

In the main the text agrees with cod. 6 (cf. Kern’s notes, ὁ 3).
But the influence os the Lex Emendata is also perceptible in many
respects. Several os his paragraphs are marked with a θ, and in
most instances these paragraphs agree exactly with those of the L.
Em. (cf. titt. VIII (1X). 4-7; XIII (XVI). 43 XIII (XIV). 12,
&c. &c.), though in other cases they evidently belong to a different
version (cf. tit. XIX (XXII) ).

Herold's book has apparently remained unfinished. In numerous
places os his work we find certain words marked with small letters
in alphabetical order. In the second chapter alone a whole series

'of such letters from a to z may be observed. Whether these letters

were intended to refer to the commentary which Herold proposed
to publish, or to notes with other readings, it is impossible to say,
as his book contains nothing except the texts os the various laws.

His text consists os 80 chapters, of which the first 71 represent
the 70* chapters of the L. Emendata. Cf. Mon. Germ. Legg. IV.
p. xxxix.

Pardessus‚ pref. LXVIII. A copy of the MS. is preserved at
Modena, but the Modena glosses, when compared with Muratori’s
readings, offer some differences3 cf. Mer'kel's glosses in his Lex

Libr. may be the MS„ as this apparently contains the Chronicle
indicated by Pithon, though it has not the Lex Salica. 5. Codex
