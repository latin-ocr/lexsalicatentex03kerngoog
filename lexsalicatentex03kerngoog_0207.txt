NOTES.

desire or want sor a system, provided we have come to a foregone
conclusion. We must not lose sight of the fact that any attempt
at explanation which is based upon one corrupted codex has little
chance of being satisfactory. We have, however, more than one
manuscript, and may, therefore, try to find some connexion, if pos·
sible, between them, in order'to discover the intention of the Lex.
Let us begin with the text of the Lex Emend„ for whatever may
have been the shortcomings of its arrangem, it has suffered incom-
parably less at the hands of ignorant scribes than au the others,
some parts of cod. 10 excepted.

The phrase ‘⁸ Et si causa aliqua ante illos secundum legem fuerit
definita, ante grafionem remouere eam non licet,” i. e. “ And if any
cause has been lawfully settled before them, it is not allowed to
remove it before the sheriff (gravzb)‚” agrees with what cod. 10
says in other words: “Et si de caussa (aliqua) illi aliquid sanum
dixerint, penitus gravio nullam habeat licentiam removendi.’' The
Latin sanus, here used in a sense alien to Latin proper, points to a
Salic original combining the meanings os sound and true. Such a
word must have sounded santb, sand (scith), O. N. sannr, Ο. 8.
scith, A. S. sos, E. sooth ; or sund, A. S. sund, gesund, E. sound,
D. gezond, essentially the Goth. sunjzlr, true; sunja, truth. Now
Ο. Ν. sannr, scoth, true, in the forensic phrase vera, verba sannr
at eina means “ to be convicted of, guilty of.” Stin more striking
is the derived verb sanna, to prove, to convict one of; the Danish
sandemoend were more especially veridici. Indeed, it is sufficiently
clear that verum dicere would have been more appropriate than
sanum dicere ,· still more suitable would have been the rendering
‘⁴ to give a verdict.” The reason why the translator-s preferred
sanum dicere is, Ι suppose, that the Salic term combined the mean-
ing οἱ Ο. N. sanna, to prove, to convict, and msa, to deny, to
prove innocence. In Oxf. Dict. i. v. sanna we find the phrase
sannam armar-r, en armar synjabae', some affirmed, some said no.
When we remember that Goth. sunjon sik (identical with Ο. N.
synja) is ἀπολογεῖσθαι, sunjons ἀπολογία, but at the same time
sunja, truth, we may be satisfied that a Salic saud, seith, or sund,
can have existed in a double meaning (¹) which we may, more or
less adequately, paraphrase by ‘⁶ a verdict in affirmative or nega·
tive sense-’²

It will be granted, that there is strong reason for suspicion that the
sact'baros are ‘⁸ veridici,” i. e. the deliverers osa verdict, in other words
jurorS, members of a jury. This provisional result is not shaken by
the text of 7—9. The expression “ante illos aliquid factum est ”
may be rendered: ‘⁶ is done (i. e. finished, settled) before them‚” or
if we like, ‘⁴ acted,’' M. D. gedadzgd, compositus, pactus3 cf. M. D.
dedingsman, arbiter, synonymous with scheid-eman ,· N. D. dading‚
transaction. Let us now pass to cod. 1. De causas aliquid (i. e.
causarum aliquid) is like the Ο. S. hwat sakono, M. D. wat saken,
“ any cause (case),‘’ and does not differ from causa aliqua. The
words following, “ de quod eis solvuntur factum dixerint ” are non-
sense. Cod. 2 has an intelligible ⁸⁴ de causa dequid (read aliquid) de
quod fortasse dixerint '’ 3 sortasse has probably the notion of “ occa-
sionally ”; ‘⁸ de quod (agreeing with aliquid) fortasse dixerunt ”
means “ about which they happen to have pronounced (their ver-
dict).” In 1 ‘⁴ de quod factum dixerint ” causes no difficulty; the
knotty point lies in “ eis solvuntur,” which is evidently corrupt.

(¹) Tine Latin sortiti-us and sons are not only etymologically akin to saud
and saud, but show the same ambiguity in so far as sontem is “ valid, serv-ing
aa sunna? and sons “ guilty, sinning,” agreeing with Ο. S. suadeo. D. tonde,-
Ο. N. θιὼ· in the min A.S. syn, E. sin.

To change it into solvitur as 3, 4, and 6 have, would make things
worse, for the construction requires a plural; eis = ei (¹) is a semi-
Latin writing for ei. There remains solvuntur for which 1 guess
we must read solverint et. Solvere, i. e. ‘⁸ to solve‚” not unh‘kely
renders a Salic lasz'an, 0. N. leysa, to solve, settle, e. g. Ieysa pratu,
to settle a strife; and with another construction lqsa dr spymingu,
to solve a problem, answer a question 3 cf. skera όν, to decide ; and
Oxf. Dict. i. v. leysa. Another possibility is that in the serni-
F rench of the Lex, ei se solvunt, means “ they have acquitted
themselves ’⁹ ς Ο. N. leysa sik is “ to aequit oneself of one’s
duty.” 1t does not matter much, Ι believe, which way we decide
between ei solven'nt et or ei se solvunt et ,· at all events there can
be no question of interpreting solvere by “to pay,’' such an idea
being entirely dispelled by the evidence of codd. 2, 7-10, and Lex
Emendata.

The last words in 1 ε “hoc ad grafionem non requiratur unde
ille securitatem fecerit '¹ may be rendered z ‘⁴ (if a cause has been
settled by them) it cannot be required from the grafio that he
should have given his troth.” But this would be nonsense; and
we could only make sense of it if the text had sacz'at. Hence
the whole phrase is not what it should be. ‘⁸ Securitas ’' is a
translation of some word wara or wan'da, which may mean ‘⁶ gua-
rantee, pledge, troth,” but also “approbation,” for O. H. G.
marjan, waren is “ probare ”3 br’wdrjan ‘⁴ probare, comprobare.”
The wording of 2, 4, and ὁ, is intelligible, though, it would seem,
sornewhat tautological. Here secun'tas is the probate by the
jurors.

On confronting the result obtained by a comparative interpreta-
tion οῖ the text with those obtained by a linguistic analysis, we
come to the conclusion that the sacibaro, sacchore, otherwise called
sagoe'baro, sagibam is the member of a jury; further that the old
paraphrase by scabinus is perfectly right, provided we understand
by schepen the vn'ykclzepem commonly designated as schepen (²) of
the veem, neira, the usual term for jury in westphalia and Hama-
land, but by no means limited to the Saxon parts of the Nether-
lands (³). Saccewito agrees with the middle Frank. ωἰεεεζξ as used in
Ripuarian Cologne (cs. Grimm, R. A. 779). That scabinus is used
to indicate the vnjkcloepen needs no proof 3 one instance will
suffice: in a charter of Δ. D. 1292 two persons are styled scabini
seu veimnoote (⁴).

We have a collateral proof that the sacibaros are nothing but
members of the jury, the veem. The vem, it is well known, is
called heimelijk, i. e. homely, communal, rural; a word which has
given rise to an the absurd stories, still here and there circulating,
about the veem. Heimeliffi, geheim, after it had become obsolete
in the sense of ‘⁸ homely, communal, popular,” survived in that of
“mysterious, secret‚” and since words, especially those which are
not understood, exercise a far greater influence on men’s minds than
is usually believed, it is no wonder that the veens, though it was as
public a meeting as any could be, became in the idea of the people
