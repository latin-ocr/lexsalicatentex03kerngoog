course, the Umlaut of ὃ. The amplified form Ο. N. froekinn bears
the same relation to frank (εμὲ) as e. g. A. S. sltb‘en to slib'e ,-
cf. O. S. ausin and the numerous Ο. N. adjectives in itm enume-
rated inthe Oxs. Dict. XXXIII. The ending ni (stem nah) offitia-ni,

etc„ the names of the men wh0‚ according to tradition, were chosen
to arrange the original Salic Law, show a striking family likeness,
to such an extent as to warrant the inference that they are fictitions.
There is besides some discrepancy in the arrangement os the names
which are said to be four in number. And there is another cir·
cumstance which must throw a doubt upon the historical character
of the tradition, viz. the identity of the words wido, sale and bodo,
which make a part of the compounds expressiug the names of the
men and their abodes. All this looks very suspicions, and suggests
the idea that the Salian Franks of the 6th century still knew of
some arrangement of the law having taken place in the days ofyore‚
in times far off, but that the particulars were blotted out from their
memory, and were therefore supplied by fiction.

The oldest form of the final part os the compound names is gasti
(Goth. gasts, etc.) ; later is gaste ,· the latest gast. The Latinized
gastus dates from a time when the final i of the stem was totally
lost. Hence the and Prologue in cod. 6, as well as Prol. III-v can-
not but be comparatively late.

Chaim (heim, hem) and cham (ham) are synonymous and inter-
changeable, as we have seen before (see Notes to Tit. ΠΙ). In
names of places throughout the Frankish and Saxon Netherlands
we find heim (shortened Ιιεηε, um) as well'as ham ; e. g. Sassenheim,
Diepenheim, Arnhem, Zelhem, Renkum (older Redinkhem); Een-
ham, Barlham. Sometimes both Item and leam are interchanged;
e. g. the name of the village called Sidehem in the Middle Ages is
at present Zeddam ; the present Kleveham occurs in a charter
A. D. 720 as Haemmi (Sloet, Oork. No. VI).

Saliis O. S. seli, A. S. sele, sel ; salo, isit be correct, stands for
sala, M. D. sale, N. D. saal, French salle ; sale may be both; cf.
A. S. sael along with sele, sel. Bada, bod (stem bada) is M. D. boede,
domuncula, casa; M. H. G. buode, E. booth ,· Ο. N. bu't5, N. D.
baed, a sty. The D. baed being synonymous with kot, E. cot, it will,
perhaps, not seem wholly fanciful if Ι infer that deogasti is but
another phrase sor D. huis-man, a cottager, peasant, and the ficti·
tious representative of the pensant-class; whereas Saliqasu is that of
the nobility living in salis. Instead of Bodogasti some MSS. have
Arogasti. Now, am looks as if it were the very same word as
Latin arvum (¹), or at any rate a derivative from an'czn, to plough,

and in substance differing neither from M. D. arene, erene, “ ar-
vum,’ 'nor from Ο. N. ὅνδ, a crop3 amr, a plough3 Ο. Fris. eni
(ras-eni), aploughing. Arogasti‚ therefore, means‘ ‘'liller, Plough·
man,' ’whence it follows that it is a persectly intelligible variant sor
Bbdogasti.

Widogasti means, apparently, “ Woodman,” for walia (ωἰᾰο,
wide) answers to O. H. G. antu, A. S. wudu, Ο. N. vii5r, E. wood.
In Wisogarti we recognize the stem mlta, Ο. H. G. wisa, N. H. G.
vn'ese, a meadow, pasture3 the compound, if taken in the sense of
an appellative, might be rendered by ‘⁸ a feeder of cattle.”

There is nothing strange in the names os the reputed arrangers of
the old Salic Law when we consider them each by itself, but the

fact of their being combined is calculated to raise doubts as to their
historical character. Would it be too sar-fetched to explain the
typical names Wisogasti, Bodogasti (al. Arogasti), Saligasti and
Widogasti as being the representatives of the different classes of
the people ? At the same time 1 am unable to account for the fact
that only three villages are mentioned. We might have expected
that fiction would have assigned a village Wisohem to Wisogasti as
the place of his domicile; Salihem to Saligasti; Bodohem (= Aro-
hem) to Bodogasti (en Arogasti); Widohem to Widogasti. But
there is no trace of anything like Wsohem in any os the lists, nor
do the names of the villages run wholly parallel to those of the
men.

Wimwa[n]do = wisogafflsso is, in my opinion, the nomin. pl. osa
pres. partic. used as a subst., like Goth. nasjands, fijands, Ο. S.
frirmd, heliand, fiand, A. S. freond, seond, etc. The final o may
be a so-called ‘⁴ irrational” vowel. The ending ado, which some
codd. show instead of ando, is not wholly inadmissible, considering
that participles ined= end occur in M. H. G„ e. g. tb'ude, balde, and
other words (cf. Grimm, D. G. I, 1008); so toointhe M. D. dialect
of Maastricht, e. g. vlzgede ·= vlzgende ,· mahnede = minnende ; in the
modern dialect the n ofmdzgstm amplified form of the pres. partic.)
is usually elided, and the d treated as if it were the final of a word
or first part of a compound; e. g. levetig, common D. livendig,
German lebendi}- ,⁰ similarly gleuetig, D. glon'endaeg, M.H.G. gluom-
dic ‚· speleug, dmimetig ,· in M. H. G. we find kmdemedejg.

The verb wisowan = wisogast (i. e. ποῶ-σχίσῃ, walsqjan) belongs, 1
think, to the weak verbs of the αι·- οι· 0- class; cs. 0. S. wacogean,
O. Η. G. wacken ;frdgoian, O. H. G. fragen ; folgoian, O. H. G.
folgen ,· thologz‘an, O. H. G. dol-«in, Goth. palan (palai->3 but
thionogean, Ο. H. G. diondn. The interesting vicarious form -owan,
whatever may be its origin, is analogous to A. S. bescnwan = be·
seyr-ian, bzscerian ; herwan,¹kyrwan = hmgean, her-ian, conviciari;
gyrwedon ει ῆηζξτίοη (S. Ettm. Lex. 522, and cs. Notes on Tit. LXI).

On the supposition that the radical vowel be a long one, we may
identify witmau, wisogast with O. S. wtu'an, A. S. wialan, 0.H.G.
misen, wis-ian, monstrare, ducere, regere; whence Ο. Η. G. viro,
dux; fora-wiso, praeco, · A. S. heremis-a, · Ο. N. visi, a leader, cap-
tain; visir, a leader, king, M. D. wt'jser, a judge. The plural os
wicmand answers to‘ ‘”rectores os the Latin text, though it would
seem more appropriate is the arrangers of the law had been qualified
as‘ ‘iudices,” M. D. wiyteere.

If, on the other hand, the t was short, the word can only be a
common pres. partic. inthe plural, meaning “ degentes, habitantes?
In this sense it has been interpreted in Prol- IV, as ‘⁸ qui vero man-
serunt ’' means ‘⁸ who dwelt, were living, having their home ”; cf.
the French word maison, and E. mansion. It cannot be denied
that there may have been a word wtsowan, wisogast answering to
Goth. wilton, which does not exactly mean “ to live‚’' as most dic·
tionaries give it, but rather “to cheer,” in an intransitive sense.
Both notions, however, are intimately connected, and the interpre-
tation adopted in the said Prologue would seem plausible enough,
were it not that the other is, to say the least of it, as well supported.
If we prefer the translation “ qui manserunt ” we must take -ndo
for the equivalent of -nda, -nde in the Frankish os the Psalms and
the Gl. L.; e. g. dnbpa'nda, Ps. 71, 6; hbbt'nda 54, 16 ς libbende
57, 103 thionda 72, ης which are all nom. pl. masc. of the pres.
part. in the strong declension.
