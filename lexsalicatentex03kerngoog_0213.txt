ξ 271. There is something wrong in the Frank. formula which
⁴ we find in this Tit. In 1 we should expect nestich anthichio, i. e.
the 3rd pers. sing. pres. subj. ‘⁴ admallet, admoneat” ς in 2 nestngr
antigzb. Antihtaejg‘zb would also be admissible, because tihtigiem,
as a vicarious form of tigian, finds its counterpart in the Ο. Fris.
subst. tz'clttega, taz-huga. It is remarkable that by the side of this
O. Fris. term we repeatedly find a variant thictegu, thichtigha, in
the Fris. LL. (153, 13 155, 9; 175, 143 2οο, 32), on account of
which we may sor 1 also adopt a reading anthzkhu'gio, anthihtigio.
That the same verb may, have as its subject the judge and the
claimant may be seen from Grimm, R. A. 855. See further
2 8.

ὁ {ceras-ante serves as a nominative3 “hoc est accusante '' is in
French “ c'est a dire l’accusant,’' that is to say, the claimant is
to be understood as the subject of anttkhtzgrb, and not the judge,
the &ung-in, etc.

ξ 272. Abounis, obbom's is explained by Grimm (Pref. LIV) as
being ‘⁸ properly an under-hood, from ob, under.” He adds: ‘⁸ allied
is the Romance boneta, bonetum, French bonnet, M. H. G. banttss’
1 have some doubt whether ob, obe (in 1 ι) does not represent briva,
O. Η. G. haba, D. huns, a hood, in composition shortened into hav,
for the a is very frequently represented by o in semi-Latin spelling,
e. g. in Chlodovehus (pron. Hlfidowihs) and the like: The a in
abonnz's may be a misread u. Bonm's, supposing it to have been
accurately Latinized, is reducible to a Frank. fem. subst. bonni =
bondi, substantially the O. H. G. gibenti, mitra; M. H. G. gebende,
for which Ι refer to the copious elucidations in Benecke-Muner,
M. H. G. Dict.

Obelimk· (or obt-linis· 3³) is obscure. Itis perhaps kobelitz, i. e. huve-
lin, N. H. G. bdublein, the diminutive of haube, a hood. Should this
conjecture be right, we must suppose that the corrector has either
forgotten to omit the final syllable is, or has seen a genit. of the
sin in it.

Igtfflizr but sair to add that Grimm’s explanation concerning ob
is countenanced by the M. H. G. underbant, decerniculum, dis-
criminale.

§273. Pecus in ᾗῇ 4, 5, and 10 is a stupid alteration offetus.
Such an error shows that the three codd„ in this part os the Lex,
are nothing but copies from one and the same original, and that a
corru t one. ·

ᾗ 217)4. Asilitum’a, miletum'a (corrupt militur-122 in Tit. LXXII),
which the scribe os 11 changed into an otherwise irreproachable but
here absurd Latin multr'tudinzlr, is a very strange word. There is
nothing uncertain about zittani, accus. litania, which is regularly
formed by the fem. suffix nia from litu, Ictu, in the same manner as
e. g. O. H. G. winan, hospita, from wirt, Goth. waitzius, hospes;

Frank. leudini from leudi, etc. Hence lituni, letum· is a female·

litus, a ‘⁸ leta.” But what is mi? The wording of cod. 1 suggests
the idea that ‘⁴ Walloon litu-women ” are meant, and if the MSS.
showed ma-litum'a, etc.‚ 1 would not hesitate to explain the term as
standing for Wallerunia. In A. S. wila‘x and wiln are well known and
easily accounted for ; in the idiom of the Franks the i is subject to

grave douth‚ unless there existed a form waliUae) along with
malave), which cannot be proved.

The wording of the three codices compels us to search, notwith-
standing all our douth, for some word denoting “romana.”
Whether we prefer the reading “letas romanas '’‚ or “letas sive
romanas ”, the notion of “ romana’' must somehow be expressed
in the term in question. Hence we get this dilemma: either the
correct reading is wallitunia, or the Franks used wil along with
wal. The agreement between the MSS. in this case carries no
weight at all, because they all flow from the same corrupted source.

§ 275. For laeuespita, leuerpita, read Ζαεποενρἰα, the pret. par-
ticiple of a Latinized laeswe-spire, jactare in laesum, i. e. tradere.
The Frank. verb must have sounded laeswerpian, a denominative

from laeswerp, a thr-owing into the leis, les ,· werpan is the common
Teutonic word, Goth. wairpan, etc.

ᾗ 276. Stadaz may be the A. S. adjective statiol in stassofferh‘o,

.supposing this word to exist, as the Dictionaries give it (see Ettm.

Lex. 735). It is more probable and safer too to take stadali for
the stem; stadali, stationary, is a regular derivative from stadal,
station. In point of fact the stadali, deer, certainly agrees
with the A. S. staelhrdn, the decoy reindeer in Orosius 1, 1, except-
ing, os course, the difference between a deer and a reindeer.

Uat'danlr, i. e. waidartk, is the genit. os waidan’, a hunter,
Ο. Η. G. wezilinari, M. D. weida-ner ; cf. Ο. H. G. wez'cldn, venari:
matta, venatio; O. N. verba, to hunt, νεῶν, a hunting 3 A. S.
waeUan, and wdtiu (sz Grein, GlosS.); D. wez'ciman, venator; wezzi-
werk, venati03 M. D. wendigh and παριᾶσι-ᾗ, venaticus, venatorius.
A stadali waidan's (hirot s? deor ?) is “ a hunter’s decoy-deer.” In
Latin we could use an adj. “ venatorius '' instead of the genit.
“ venatoriS.” ,

ὁ 277. Bos cervi is a clumsy Latinization of some word like
N. H. G. hirschkuh, a doe, properly ‘⁴ a deer-cow.” Another
instance of the word cow being used to denote the female of some
animals is Ο. S. cti-min, a sow (see Heyne, Kl. D. 144).

ξ 278. For tribute (or rather atribute, atributari) the original
must have had chatnudhfi, i. e. “ triutim habenS,” or a similar
phrase which some scribe, in his eagerness to give a Latin shape to a

TIT-ml which he did not understand, changed into (a)tributc. Cf.
1t. XXXIII.

LXXXI.

ξ 279. Πεπῖωιήία (by which theulmim'a is meant) is slightly
corrupt. There is no q'uestion os coaxing away a slave, a theu, but
of filching a thret, a pedica. We have to read accordingly thr-uld-
sinia. As regards thr-u, thruh, cf. Notes to Tit. XXXIII. An-
other instance οἰ r having been mistaken for e is afforded by cende
for crude in the heading of Tit. LVIII in cod. 10.

ὁ 280. Neuu, in ἦ 1, and uena in the subsequent ᾗ, which the
scribe thought it necessary to correct by changing them into nave,
represent vena, otherwise spelt venna, vinna ; see Ducange, i. v.
venna and vena 4. From a passage quoted in Ducange it appears
that venna is synonymous with uer (wer), Ο. N. ver, Ο. S. verr,

{XssIef’ a fishing station. Cf. the Note on vertiwlo in Tit.
