INTRODUCTION.

As this work was undertaken with the intention of supplying
materials and facilities for a thorough study of this important docu-
ment, no attempt has been made to give what is usually called a
cn‘tical edition. The codices have been reproduced without any
alteration except in the punctuation, which is my own, and may
be altered by the reader at his pleasure3 that of the MSS. is in
most cases a full-stop, and usually placed where it is not cus·
tomary at present to put one. The letters represented by contrac-
tions in the MSS. are represented in print by italics, except in the
Glosses, which are given as they appear in the MSS. Only in one
or two instanceS, where the type did not readily lend itself to a
representation of the contractions of the Gloss, italica have been
used, e. gr. in ch. 3, ᾗ 2 (thinzimus of cod. 8), and ch. 5, ᾗ 1
(haper of cod. 7). I have not extended the words denarii, denarios
qui faciunt solidi, solidos, and culpabilis iuda-etur, which occur in
the MSS. in almost every paragraph, and nearly always abridged.
1 have printed uniformly: den. . . . qui fac. sol. . . . culp. iud„
extending by italics the contractioris of the MSS. as far as was
necessary to keep up this uniformity.

In some cases where a correction has been made by the scribe of
the MS. or by some cotemporary corrector, 1 have given both the
original word and the emendation. But this was not possible every-
where, as sometimes the original word is no longer legible. Obser-
vations on readings or corruptions in the texts are placed by the
side of the texts in a separate column, where also references are
given to corresponding or similar enactments in the other Barbarian
LawS, including the A. S. LawS, but not the vernacular F ris-ian nor
any of the Skandinavian Laws· The Glossarial Index is intended
1⁰ to be an Index to all the words treated in Kern’s N otes, and 2⁰
to register all words and phrases of any importance in the Lex
Salica. Very few words occurring in the Salic Law can be properly
discussed without quoting a variety of other Mediaeval documents.
As this was not my plan, 1 have given only such explanation-s or
observations on words or readings in the texts as could be reason-
ably expected in an Index prepared more with the view of facilitat-
ing than satisfying inquirieS. On coll. 565 and 566 will be found
further explanations regarding. the Index. The Glosses from the
Cod. Est. διε. inserted in the Index have been taken from Merkel’s
edition. The abbreviations made use of in the column of observa-
tions are :—

The order in which the first 65 chapters are given will explain
itself3 that 111 which the rest of the work appears has been explained
at the commencement of each fresh set of chapters or each new
document, with the necessary references to other works in which
they have been published. It will be observed that more attention
has been paid to the place which the chapters or document occupy
in the MSS. than to any date assigned to them by Perta, Pardessus
&c. The uncertainty as to the time when, or the kings from whom,

· the later portion (after ch. 65) of the Lex Salica emanated, is as yet

so great that it is unsafe to arrange it in any definite order.

The chapters have been divided into paragraphS, and the divisions
ofPardessus, Merkel, and Behreud retained as much as was compa-
tible with the divisions in the MSS.

All possible precautions to secure accuracy have been taken, ‘but
errors have crept in notwithstanding. The reader is requested to alter
the following, and to pardon any others that may have been over-
