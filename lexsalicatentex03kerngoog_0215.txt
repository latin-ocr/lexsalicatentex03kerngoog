NOTES. TITT. cvl. CVII.

before us by a process similar to that by which gamalius, chamul-
lus in Tit. XLVII became arnallus. Tbere need be no difference
between wilm and gawz'ttia, any more than e. g. between A. S.
vita, πίττα, and gemm, testis; witnes and gewitnes, testi-
momum.

ς 291. Wedred, widerld (in sect. 5) is the counterpart of the
O. Fris. warbeth, m'thed, i. e. literally “ with-cath,’' or, as the
Latin translation hybridically calls it, withjuramenmm. Wither
(vn'der, weder) differs no more from πῖθι than aster from afl,· at
one time both forms freely interchanged not only in the sense of
against, as e. g. in A. S. m'Uersteall or winsteall, Ο. N. mbr-stava
or vivs-tauta, resistance, but also in that of with, together, e. g.
Ο. N. m'b‘rmoeli or viUmoeli, conversation, a colloquy3 mbr-tal and
viUtaI, conversation.

ὁ 292. For gauialto (which occurs in sect. 7 os cod. 10) read
gamalto == gamaelta of 11. The ending os the dat. fem. of the
strong decl. is, just as in the Frank. Psalms‚ sometimes a (e. g.
hera, Gl. L. 564; scama, 7913 solda, 7773 stimma, Ps. 67, 35),
and sometimes o (u) (e. g. hlothu, Gl. L. 578; salethu, Ps. 14, 13
saldo, 84, 10).

ς 293. Ebr, ibet· is, in all probability, the well-known Teutonic
word for “a boar,” A. S. cosor, D. ever, O. Η. G. ebur ; cf. the
Frank. name Ebroin, i. e. Ebrwz‘n. Even the cockneyism hebr in 11
finds its counterpart in Ο. Η. G. heber (s. Graff, Spr. I. 100),
perhaps by mere accident. The fact that the D. beer is a
technical term for a pier, a prop of a wall, a certain war-engine
(the Latin vinea), and that another synonym, namely, the Frisian
bar-chen (English barrows), denotes piles for the support of sea-
dikes (¹), warrants the conclusion that the Franks used ὠν in the
same technical sense of a prop of some kind, even if we are unable
to determine its precise meaning in this passage. It remains doubt-
ful whether it is allowable to infer from the 'ending ius that the
word was occasionally treated as a stem in u.

ᾗ 294. anastina, in 7 and 8, sn'bastina (pron. sn‘vastina), in 9
(A. 1) is a compound offri, o.S. fri, A.S. frea, a young woman, a
lady, and justina, the nom. act. ossastt‘an, or fastinbn, spondere,
sponsare3 cf. Ο. N. sastna, to betroth; O. H. G. fasti, conscriptio
coniugii; sertin, pactum; M. H. G. vestenen, to betroth; e. g. in
Kudrun 665: ‘⁸ Do vestent’ man die schoenen dem recken an der
stunt ”3 beve-stenen, to betroth, e. g. Kudrun 770: ‘⁸ Dem bin ich
bevestent: ich lobete in z’einem man, er nam mich ze wibe.”

anrasx’gena (better snfrasegena) contains the same fri and
smsegena, the nom. act. of frasegr'an, Ο. H. G. sersagen, renun-
tiare, abdicare.

anastina renders “ filiam alienam sponsare”; while safra·
segma answers to “ se retraxerit et eam accipere noluerit.''

ᾗ 295. De inuicta stn'cto (A. 111.) The A. S. inwit, malignity,
can hardly be the word here intended, though its existence in
Frankish may have contributed to the original reading having be-
come corrupt. 1 assume the true reading is uuita (= uuita,

uuam) stricto (i. e. stricato), stricto (for stn'hto). Wita, witta, gen.
πίω (πίω) or wita, is apparently identical with M. D. wite, m'tte,
the awning of a cart, otherwise called huive, huz-'fi Since '⁸¹⁴9‘ is
the common word sor a cois, hood, bonnet, O. H. G. haba,
M. H. G. habe, Ο. Fris. Ieme, O. N. hu'sa, etc„ there can be no
doubt that mre, wt'tte had once a much wider sense. In fact, it is
nothing but O. Η. G. witta, infula, Ο. Fris. wiffam, witta, etc.
That the notion of “ awning ” is a secondary one may be gathered
{rom the fact that the French word for it is banne, evidently
derived from a Frankish banna, banda, a band; cf. E. bandow.
Our conjecture is confirmed by the uuam-zm of Pithoeus. Str-arma,
dat. strichto, is a fem. subst„ a derivative from strio-an, E. to strike,
etc.. here to be taken in the sense of striking off. Ofstrtca is the
very term for striking off a cap, bonnet, hood, etc„ in Ο. Fris„ as
we learn from the Fris. LL. 212, 32-“Enre frowa hire hneze
osestrizen, fiarda half scilling.” Wtu (m'tta) sirr'chta is “ the
striking off a head-gear,” be it a cois, a cap, or a bonnet.

The words “ pittum excusserit ” in the text must necessarily
express the same idea; hence pitius means some kind of head-dress.
This word seems to be identical with D. pet, a cap. Τὴο origin os
pitius is obscure.

ᾖ 296. (Sexxaudro, read) sexxandro (A. lv) is the gen. plural of the
participle, used as a substantive, from sexxan for sexian, older
saksian, a verb which, with slight difference, agrees with Ο. N.
saxa, to chop, hack. The meaning os the Frank. seh-ran certainly
was that of cutting (grass or corn). For “ cultenus” the Franks un-
doubtedly had sax, salas, Ο. H. G. sales, A. S. secas, Ο. N. sax ,· as
they called ‘⁸ a razor'’ sear-salu, as we know from Gl. L. 7923
Ο. S. scer-sahss, Gl. Prud. 402.

ᾗ 297. Anthmal (in ch. 1 δι 2) is a bad spellingfor hanhnal, Ο. S.
hartdmahal (Heliand, 11, 1. 11. 126, 7), M. D. Ιιαηιηιαεῑ, which
Kiliaen renders by: “ Forum competens ; forum proprium, bannus
scabinalis: iurisdictio in qua quis natus magistratu fungi potest:
patritius magistratus, patritiatus.”

ᾗ 298. Stet-chire (in ch. 7) is a Latiuized Frank. πίση-ἀτη, O. S.
sterkian, Ο. Fris, sterkia, M. D. sterken, firmare, confirmare, pro-
bare, O. H. G. ster-chan, ktlrtarkan. The ch in sterchire serves, in
the Italian manner, to denote the ksound before the vowels e and i,
and should not be confounded with the H. G. cle.

ς 299. The epithets “ audax, velox vel asper,” render different
shades of meaning of the adj. franc, a word which is intimately
connected with A. S. fiee, O. H. G. freh, N. H. G. frech, “ audax,
protervus, procax,’' as well as with A. S. srecne, Ο. S. flua-ni, asper,
atrox, audax, Ο. N. sroekn, andsroekinn, valiant, stout. That franc,
like frec and srOcni, could also be taken in an unfavourable sense we
know from the testimony os Ermoldus Nigellus, for he says (Ι. 344):
‘⁸ Francus habet nomen a feritate sua.'’
has: “ France ferox ’⁹ ; cf. Grimm, G. D. S. 358, where it is
pointed out that the D. vrank en νη] is the counterpart os the
M. H. G. srech undfrt.
