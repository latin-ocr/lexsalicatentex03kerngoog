genuine readings. In like manner the reading of 7, 8, 9 points
to a common suiani or suianni. All these forms are decidedly
derivatives from sa, and show an unmistakeable analogy with Ο. N.
ἐνί, a fold or pen, and kvt'ga‚ a young cow, from ku'. Supposing
the g in suegano to have arisen from a j (in sutjani) Ι would com-
pare the Skr. derivatives in ydyani, e. g. karmdrydyagzi, a patro-
nymic belonging to kdrmdra (see B. & R. Dict. i. v. kdrmarya).
The variation soagm', however, would seem to be more closely
allied to such Skr. derivatives as kaur‘i'jdyana (see Β. & R. Dict.
i. v.) from kur‘ija. Originally identical with soagm‘ of 10 is soagne
(chalte), which occurs a few lines further down in 10 and 6,
suane (calte) in ὲ, suuachine in 3. The translators of the Law
recognized in this word the Ο. H. G. swein, subulcuS, A. S. swdn,
E. swain, etc. Hence the Lat. words “ipso porcario attendente,
(custodiente).” Without questioning the fact that in Frank. soagne,
suianni, etc„ also signified a ‘⁴ porcariuS,” I think the rendering of
soagnechalt by ‘³ porcus ipso porcario attendente '’ is a mistake.
All the forms mentioned can, according to the manner of their deri-
vation, mean either “a family of swine,” or a single member,
especially a young one, of the family, or a person tending swine.
It would seemthat the Frank translators themselves were at a loss
to decide which of the three meanings of soagne was intended by
the componnd magne-chalet, and were therefore not satisfied with
“⁴ ipso porcario attendente‚” but added also “ de intro porcoS,” or
“ in campo inter porcOS.’' We must bear in mind that in a com-
pound any difference of gender of soagm is lost. An interesting
proof of the existence of suane in Ο. H. G. is afforded by a passage
in Notker's Psalm 79, 14, where the Lat. “ singularis ferus ”is ren-
dered by and amplified to der einluzzo wilde ber der mit demo
sudnen‘nge ne gat: ‘⁸ the single boar that goes not with the herd
of pigS.’' .

§ 21. Taxaga, texaca (read texaga or texacha); texeca (read
texega or texecha); taxaca (read taxaga); texaga, has been rightly
connected with O. Η. G. rascdn, rapere, by Grimm (Pres. VIII).
The infinitive of the Frank. verb must have been taxaian, taxoian,
tamara, teman, after the analogy of Ο. S. wamiam· A. S. buhhan,-
D. hebben (for havian, hafaian) ; O. S. libbian and libam· Ο. Η. G.
leben, and the like. In other wordS, the Frank. verb must have
belonged to the Goth. ai class; hence the Umlaut of the radical
vowel. Such verbs were afterwards confounded with verbs of the
Goth. ο class. The substantive is formed in the same way as tiloga,
exercitatio (O. Η. G. zz’lunga), from tilon (in Frank. Ps. 54, 3);
hatega, aemulatio (Gl. Lips. 551), from hatoian (Ο. S. hatogean),
baton, O. H. G. haten and hazan. The x for sc reminds us of the
A. S. fix for fise, dxian, and the like. Technically, texaga denotes
a certain degree of the crime of robbery, punishable by a fixed fine

of 1400d. Thus it has become a forensic term implying a fine of =

that value. Now, ingymtlr-texaga, if taken as a compound, can
only mean “ stealing of yearlings.” But the question arises
whether it is really a compound, about which more below. Exa-
chalc etcepto tuaseptunchunna in 10 exhibits several blunders3
exachalt should be tex-acham), as in ξ 12 of the same cod. ; etcepto
is an anticipation of excepto in the next line. Tua septunclumna
manifestly expresses “two sevenhundreds'’ or ‘⁴ two heptads of
hundreds” = 1400 den. ; and is synonymous with, or a paraphrase
of, texaga. For septun we should rather expect sepfiun, seven,
01· sepkunt (for sephund), a heptad (cf. O. N. varmei), since
septun cannot be traced in any other Teut. language. Should the
reading, after all, be right, then the form is to be identified with
Lithuanian septym} cf. Notes on the ChunnaS.

TIT. Π.

ὁ 22. Redom'a in 1 (ᾖ 10) is put in the wrong place ; 30. too, is
sunnis-ta in the same codex (§ 11), where mistakes of the same kind
are more frequent than in the other codd. We have seen that a
“post anniculatus'' is termed drage, drache ; but redom'a is the name
fora “ scrofa ducaria.'' Cod. 6 writes radonia ,· 2 redonii,· 10 chre-
dunia ,· 7 and 9 reodimia ,· 8 reodemia (read reodunia or reedunia).
This interesting word is regularly derived from Goth. rvr-spus, herd
of swine ς A. S. wrcen, Old Swed. wrath, wrdd, Dan. vraad
(cf. Grimm, D. G. 111, 475). The suffix is the femin. ni, m’a, also
occurring in Frank. lz'tum'a, leudinia, etc. The radical vowel in the
A. S., Dan. and Swed. word is long, like that in the Skr-vrdta‚ aherd.
The i in Goth. ‘euripus is of doubtful value, because a dialectic Ξ
for ἐ (e. g. qimi, St. Luke‚ 7, 3; qipeina, 8, 56) is far from rare,
especially in St. Luke‚ where wripus is found. The Frank. forms
are equally uncertain in regard to the quality of the vowel, for a
Goth. e, Ο. H. G. A, is generally represented in the idiom of
the Malberg and the Psalms by d, but occasionally also by ἐ. The
same applies to the O. S. of the Merseburg glosses (for examples
see Heyne, Kl. D. XIV), and even of the Heliand. Hence we
may safely assume the a to be long in radonia (f or ωνάιίονιία), but
must leave undecided both the quality and quantity of the e in
chredum'a, redonia. Owing to this uncertainty we cannot be sure
whether the eo in reodunia be a mere mistake for reedunia, i. e.
redunia, or the u· Umlaut of a short e, as in A. S. seofon, or dialec-
tic D. veul (for velo, Goth. filu), zeuven (for sevon), deuse (for thesin) ς
Ο. N. sb'kkva (for senkva), etc. From the same root madh is de-
rived O. N. νάδί, a boar. If at first sight it seems strange that the
initial w has been dropt in the Frank. word at so early a period, it
must be observed that we find another instance exhibiting a com-
paratively advanced degree of phonetic decay in the idiom of the
Malberg in lammi, lem, a lamb, of Tit. IV. We have an example
of a transitional form between wredum'a and redum‘a in chredunia
(pron. hredum'a) in 10; compare the D. pronunciation of reus, a
giam, in which the r is sounded as in ring (for bring), rug (for
brug), thereby pointing to a form hreus (for hmo), intermediate
between G. n'ese, Ο. Η. G. riso, and Frank. wulre'l in Ps. 18, 6 and
Gl. L. 1067. Still more striking is britan for writan in Gl. Prud.
(in britantkabn 327, along with n'ttun 358). This same word, in D.
also njten, and the above-mentioned reus, are the only words in
which the D. has dropt the initial w ,· otherwise, in contradistinction
to H. G., D. retains the sound, e. g. in wreed, whilst E. takes up a
middle position by writing, without sounding, the letter.

§ 23. A boar is called cnktzau, cn'stau, chnlrtiao, culs-tiana. Both
reading and interpretation are somewhat doubtful. The normal
form of the gloss 1 take to be gn'm'an, clanlrticm, whereas gnis-tiano,
c[}1] ηἱςίτὶιηο, shows an additional 0, not rare in the Malberg, especially
after an n ,· cf. the remarks on ohserw, Tit. 111. The other readings
are corrupt. The word seems akin to Skr. ghrshpi, a boar, to which
it may stand in the same relation as suane, suiani, suenio to sti. On
the other hand it must be admitted that it recalls O. N. gnis-s,
Swed. and Dan. gris, a young pig, a pig3 Dan. grisew, scrofa;
O.N. gri-clinga porcellus (Bj. Hald. i. v.). In the latter case 1 am
at a loss to account for trano, tian, unless it be the M. D. diminu-
tive suffix tiam (i. e. ticin, or ζγὰη), which is not probable. 1
rather think that gristian is the acc. sing. of grinio.

ᾗ 24. For “maialis votivus” 1 has mammodo or rhammodo,
read thammodo. The word is apparently an adj. masc. of the
weak declension used as a subst.; thammod (tamod) is the partic.
perf. paSS. of the verb tamon, Ο. Η. G. mmo‘n, domare; and may,
therefore, be fittingly rendered by “ mansuetus.'' The notion of
