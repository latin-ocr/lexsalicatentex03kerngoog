NOTES. TITT. VII. VIII.

into t, according to the mle, whereas the elision οἷά between n and
d in sundolin is equally warranted, · e. g. ond -ι- doen becomes in
M. D. ont· doen or omioni, and even ontoen. Dolz'n, dilen, admits
osa compar-ison with N. H. G. duln= dohle, dahle (cf. Grimm, D.

W. i. v. dahle). As in Μ. H. G. we have bergdol, a mountain-

daw, the existence of a swirnming-daw or sea-daw (suad-doliu)
would be sar from improbable. It may be added that for the
H. G. dohle, a daW, the Low-Germ. has quite a different word,
ᾰὶὶε, without doubt the same word as D. alk, Ο. N. dlka, E. auk,
the well-known sea-sowl, in would-be Latin “ alca.” The final oin
sundolino is additional or the mark of some case.

Why the same sondolino, sundelz'no, sundolino, need not be
regarded as an error where it stands in the Malb. in 7, 8, 9, added
to spemarius, 1 have attempted to explain above. 6 and 10 have
the different readings socelin, suc-elin. Grimm (Pref. XXIV)
identifies it with Lithuan. sakalas, Slavonian sokol, a falcon. We
might as well think os Low-Germ. siukan-dr, a hawk (¹). If we
wish to connect the divergent readings and to reduce them as much
as possible to one source, instead os treating them as is they had
nothing whatever in common, we should read sotelin, sutelin, for
sonttelin, sunttelim which stands to sundelin in the 331110 relation as
M. D. ontaen to ondam.

ἦ 60. Acock is called chartas-auido (i. e. channaswido) in 10, c(h)an-
rea-mutilo in 6, annasuiuido in 7, cannasuz‘uido in 9 (read channa„
Mnnmfflo). We have to add hinniswith of 1 (3. ἦ 57). This
word, interesting for more than one reason, is a compound of
haam (channa), hinni, O. H. G. henna (for hauja), heinna, M. D.
henne, hinne, E. hen, and swithi, ποῖαί, vigorous, Ο. S. witha,
πυῒδί, midi, A. S. ποὲδ, Goth. swt‘nps, etc. Just like its Icel.
synonym kvatr, vigorouS, the Frank. word is here used in the sense
os “ a male,’' 0. g. hvatrkb'ttr, a tom-cat (cs. Oxf. Diet. i. vv. hvatr
and blaussr). In so far as channen-wida, hinniswith is a compound,
it keeps close to the O. H. G. haee heninnono, gallus, gallinaceus
(Graff, Spr. IV, 958), sor channa not in composition would be con-
strued in the plur. genitive. The Ο. H. G. haeo is essentially the
same as M. D. hie, hi, properly the pronoun “ he,’' but, when used
as a substantive, it is the usual term for ‘⁴ a male osanimals ’' (²). Of
this hie, hi, Ο. Η. G. haeo is an extended form; another is O. N.
ltaeingr, loeaengr (s. Oxf. Diet. i. v.), which usage has restricted to
the male salmon, al. hvatr lax. It is not a little interesting to find
the form swtth instead of swinth already in the oldest Frankish
documents known, · as to the Frank. of the PsalmS, suitho, nimiS, is
transmitted to us in Gl. L. 872; in M. D. swide was used along
with (ξε).ηω“,ηᾱ 0. 8. Μο113 Stoke, 11, 495: Doesi sagken there so
swidest ‘when they saw the host so strong” ; even in more modern
D. mzklig occasionally occurs, though it is nowadays superseded
by ges-wind (cf. Κ11. 1. v. swindtgh and the note to it). The ο 111
chaunasrvido is the sign of the weak masc. nominative (³).

§ 61. The word for a hen is solampinam in 6, 10, 7, solamphinam
in 9. Grimm (Pref. XXV) deems it akin to M. D. sclemp‚ lepidus, and
at the same time to Czechian slepice, a hen, properly ablind or pink-
ing hen, Moravian and Slowak slepka, sh'pka. I am rather inclined

(²) E. g. Macriant, Naturen Bloeme, v, 56 :

(⁸) Among the various words for 3 cock in Skr„ the one corresponding to
ηνιϊο is daksha, properly ‘fthe strong one.”

to see in so the M. D. soe (¹) “ a female ”3 N. H. G. sie, sieke.
Lampinam looks doubtful, in so far as a final m is wholly out of the
question. 1 propose to read haninnana, the genit. pl. of haninna ,-
sb haninnana as a term for the hen is just the counterpart of
O. H. G. liaeo hem'nnono, the cock. That haninnana is as much
justified as haninnono would be, is proved by O. 8. treuuana
(Heliaud, 140, 1) interchanging with treuuono (143,1o). We must

bear' m mind that the generic name “”hen in common language
includes the cock.

§ 62. At the words‘ ‘de trappa' ’the Malb. has baofalla 111 6, ac
falla in 10 and 7, lau-falla in 8, hacfalain 9. We have to read at
falla, which by graphical cockneyism was written hat s. and was
further corrupted to bao. At is, of course, Ο. 8. at, E. at, etc. ; all
verbs with the notion of taking, getting, buying, bidding, and the
like require in Goth„ Ο. Ν., O. S., O. Fris„ etc„ the preposition at,
where the Greek uses παρά 0. genit. or ἀπό, the Latin de. Theresore
it is certain for syntactical reasons that the true reading is atsalla.
Falla is the dat. sing. of a probably strong femin„ answering to
A. S. seall, decipula (as given by Lye, cf. Ettm. Lex. 337), and
differing from the weak O. H. G. salla. The quasi-Latin trappa
itsels is a Teutonic word, A. 8. treppe, decipula, E. trap, M. D.
trappe, muscipula, decipula. Derived from the Frankish trappa are
D. &trappa-n, to catch, and the French attraper. ,

ᾗ 63. Sandolino in 1 has gone astray; it belongs to the preced-
ing Title (s, Μ 54, 59). Leodardi would be equally misplaced, if it
were no corrupt reading, as leodardi 0311 only stand where the fine
amounts to oood.; but it is really a corruption, and, as we shall
see, an interesting one.

Antedi, untedio means “breaking open,” i. e. theft with break-
ing, and, by amplification, also denotes the fixed amount os penalty
for such a delict, viz. 18ood. It is derived from a supposed verb
anian, M. D. ontoen (e. g. antede, aperuerit, Theophilus, 421, sqq.),
the same as ontdoen (e. g. Beatrijs‚ 7 57), O. 8. antduan and andbn,
Ο. H. G. anttuon, A. S. unddn, aperire. The t stands for tt, assi·
milated from td, as in M. D. ontoen, ontaen ,· ontede. Another way
os assimilation is shown in Ο. S. anddn sor anddbn ,· cf. the rela-
tion between sundolino and macelin, supposing my analysis of this
word, as given in ξ 59, to be right. The ἱ 111 antidi is either the
equivalent of a simple d, as in the Frank. Psalms in andredandi,
Gl. L. 25, by the side os andrddendero, Gl. L. 26, αηᾱνάαἰοηᾱοη,
Ρ3. 59, 6, or, more probably, the Umlaut οἷά, 33 111 gevi, Ps. 59, 6,
bes-ite, 73, 23 etc. antedi, is neuter, must have been formed like
Ο. Ν. ddoetsi, but considering the other form antideo it is more
likely a femin. and a stem in ἐς 3 dat. instrum. de‘dio might be
formed like Ο. S. bradiu, Hel. 9, 12 ; a dat. dedi like Ο. S. da'di ,·
a nomin. dedi would agree with O. Fris. dede. Besides antedi,
untedio and antedeo, we frequently meet with slight variations of
it, all os them corrupt forms or due to bad orthography.

For “apiarium ”—to use for shortness sake the common Latin word
-6 has olephardis, olechardis ,· 10 alethardaezr, aletkardis ,· 7, 8, 9 ole-
charde, elecharde, holecardo ; obduratis, abgrates ; 1 holeckamlr.
The latter part os the compound is clear: we ought to read char-dir,
charmis (sor gardr's, gartln‘s (²), garthes), the genit. sing. of gard,

(²) Soe is another form of suwe, aud a variant in the passage from Maerlant
quoted in a preceding note.

(¹) The tle for d after ris peculias Frankish; e. g. sarth, iter, ferlloe ,· Gl-
ferthe'alternating with Efferdi, all occur-ring in the Psalms (cf. Heyne, Kl. D.
i. vv.); rt for νά occurs also in Ο. Fris„ 0. g. ondertia for onderdia.
