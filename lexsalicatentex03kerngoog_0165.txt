NOTES.

(chwz‘u, chwz‘, elui) ofano (ovano, abana, avane), N. Η. G. wz'e
oben, has been literally rendered by the Latin “sicut superius.”
Since the fine “ as above ’' is a leodardi, it is a matter of course
that the expressions “as above ” and leodardi are virtually the
same; hence “sive ” in 10. A similar expression is soso iz beer
obana giret-than ist in the Ο. H. G. translation of the Lex Sal.
Tit. Ι.

In 6 and 10 rephuouarm, reppophano‚ remain to be explained.
This is either another corrupted variant of huuc (hwe) ovano
(ophano) or an attempt os somebody to correct an already corrupted
reading by writing an otherwise well-known word, viz„ rep, a rope,
because the text speaks of “ligamen.” If it be a conjecture, it is
at any rate an inadmissible one, for the remaining syllables humano,
pophano, are perfectly meaningless. There can hardly be any doubt
that this Malb. too contains ovano, opham, “superius,’' and that
the word preceding it is one of the multifarious forms of the con-
junction answering to ‘⁴ sicut.'' That the r sometimes origi-

nates in a misread c appears from rhamallus, in Tit. XLVII. ls

we restore the c and transpose a couple of letters, we get as the
probable reading, common to 6 and 10, clmeo ephano.

§ 54. The difficulties caused by the bad condition of the MSS.
are enhanced by those arising from the subject of this Title. It
need not be said that various species of birds are often named alike,
whereas different names are applied to one and t-he same species,
This circumstance seems to have perplexed the translators or revi-
sers os the law almost as much as it‘ does us, and to have left them in
doubt about the true meaning of the F rankish words they found in
their original text3‚ their Malberg. Thus we find in 7, 8, 9, the
same Malbe'rg, wadelino, added to “ speruarius '⁹ as well as to
“ anser aut aneda domestica.” At first sight this looks strange;
first, because the word sund unmistakeably points to an aquatic bird,
as we shall see' hereafter; secondly, because the common Frank.
word‘ for sparrow·hawk was certainly sparwari, sper-wari, M. D.

· spareware, sperwere, speerware, sporeware (¹), Ο. H. G. spor-zoam,

span'wan', sperwere, etc. (cf. Graff, Spr. VI, 363), N. D. sper-wer,
N. H. G. sperber. But if we look closer into the matter and observe
that not only the sources of Grais, but also those of Kiliaen, i. ν.
sper-wer, render it by ‘⁴ nisuS,'’ and further that another name of
th'e ‘⁸ nisus ” is ‘⁸ haliaeetu3,” in which ἅλς is as unmistakeable as
suna, we must hesitate before we pronounce the Malb. sundelino
to be an error. It seems more likely that sundelino more particu-
larly denoted the musket, and that the translators, not knowing the
exact Latin equivalent, took to the Latinized F rankish sper-marius,
perhaps because some Franks applied spemari also to the musket.
Indeed, the Dutch sper-wer denotes the sparrow-hawk as well as the
musket. Kiliaen renders musket by “ haliaeetus, nisus: avis ex
accipitrum fringillariorum genere,” and sper-wer by “ accipiter frin-
gillan'uS, accipiter minor mas ε nisuS, vulgo sperweriu3.” He adds
the highly interesting notice: “wemm'us in Latina translatione
legis Salicae accipitur pro accipitre minore.” It is a pity that we
do not know what codex of the Lex he used, and whether he had in
view the gloss in 7, 8, 9, or any other reading.

Is, on the one hand, we must take care not to impugn the reading
of the codd. without sufficient cause, we ought not on the other

hand to shut our eyes to their manifest faults. Thus, for instance,
we could not pardon the gross blunder of cod. 1, the oldest text,
which transfers sundolino, a word undoubtedly denoting one or
more species of birds, to the next chapter on bees! See further ᾗ 59.

§ 55. The Latin words “ accipitrem de arborem furaverit ” are quite
nugatory, unless “accipiter de arbore’' be the rendering of some
compound like Ο. H. G. poumfalclw or witefalcho‚ D. boomvalk,
which Kil. renders by ‘⁸ arborarius falcO.” The Malb. to it in 10 is
ortfocla. Focla is, in spite of the agreement among the codd„ a
misreadfogla, if not sogal. Fogla, isit be a singular, can only be
the dative, the use of which here may be explained in-the same way
as in Titt. ΙΙΙ and VI with reference to the construction os Ο. Ν.
stela. F urther on we find fugio in 7, 8, 9, and again fucla. Both
should be corrected into fugla. Fugium (uenhzjf‘ugium) in 1
points to fugl0, which, it must be confessed‚ looks rather like an
instrumenta] than a dative. It is just possible that fugIa, fogla,
fugl0‚ are plurals in the genitive (¹), but the Latin text, does not
warrant the supposition that the original Frankish showed plural
forms. Fog(a)l‚ fugl, Ο. H. G. sogal, fugal, O. N. fogl‚ fugl, etc.,
needs no comment. Orflocla in o should be ortfogla, not because
flogl is unheard of, for flugol, volucris, really exists in A. S. (cf.
Ettm. Lex. 302), but because the·same cod. afterwards repeatedly
writes ortsocla.

’ The latter part of the compound ortfogl is clear, but what is the

former? Grimm (Pref. XXIV) explains the word as meaning
‘⁴ the bird sitting on the spear, on the point,” from ord, Ο. H. G.
ort, cuspis, A. S. ord, M. D. oort, etc. Grimm's etymology is
plausible enough, for a Frankish ord regularly passes into ort, when
the d is final, just as in Dutch; and though ord is not exactly
“ a spear,” it has at least a cognate signification. But if ort stands
sor ord, how shall we account for orto, ortho which once occurs in 7,
8, 9, and uertlzi in 1 Ρ ,Οἱ a Frankish orto instead of ord there can
be no question, unless all the MSS. have made the same mistake. Let
us see whether there are similar words, likely to throw light on ort-
fogal, in the cognate languageS. In O. N. we have gez'rfdlkz' (²),
in Ο. H. G. induebat-buc, walhapuc, erodius (cf. Graff, Spr. IV,
755). Gez'rr meaning “a spear,” we may explain geirfdlki as properly
signifying “ a speaifalcon,” or (as A. S. spere, etc., also denotes
‘⁶ contus'’) a ‘⁸ bar-falcon.” Wal(u) is etymologically identical
with Goth. walus, a rod, wand; hence the walahapuc may be the
“ accipiter de pertica” ; but as we find, along with O. H. G. walu-
hapuc and A. S. weallzasoc, an O. H. G. walt-fizlcko, erodiuS‚ we
remain in doubt whether wal in the compound may not be taken
in the sense of “wood.” In the latter case walhapuc would answer
to “accipiter de arbore.’' Where we are not able to trace the
historical development of a word, its true etymology will be doubt„
ful ς we may know the component parts, the elements of the word,
but we cannot with certainty decide which of the multifarious values

no more a. Latin word than phenix is an English one. Pliny, an authority on
the subject, knew no such word as falco. It is clear that Ο. Η. G. salacho,
fulcho, is in the main identical with the Skr. palanka, i. e. it is derived from
a radical pal. whence a. 0. Skr. polita, Gr. πόλιος, Lat. pallidus, Teut.
