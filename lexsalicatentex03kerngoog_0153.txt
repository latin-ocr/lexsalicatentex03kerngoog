NOTES.

days to compile a Latin text? After their conversion to Catholicism
and the settlement of their king in the heart of France, where they
came among a Latin-speaking population, the aspect of things
changed. A Latin edition, adapted to new circumstanceS, was at
that time as much wanted, or thought to be necessary, as it was
superfluous before.

The study of the so-called glosses has led me to the supposition
that the Latin text of the Lex Salica is a revised and translated
edition, made long after the date of its original compilation. The
boundaries named in Tit. XLVII, a title in the first part of the
Lex, are simply impossible sor any period previous to Chlovis.

It may be asked whether the genuinely original law was or was
not committed to writing. There is no essential difference between
poems, laws, moral preceptS, etc„ handed down by oral tradition
or in writing. The Vedas are not a whit less authoritative or less
rigidly fixed because they were perpetuated by tradition (¹). Far
from being dependent upon Vedic manuscriptS, the latter on the
contrary are of unusual correctness», because the stains could at any
time be washed out by the clear waters of the everflowing fountain
of tradition. No codices can vie in purity with the Vedic textS,
nay, not even inscriptions on brass or rocks, exposed as they are to
the all corroding influence of time. In the case of the Salic Law,
however, Ι do not entertain the idea of its having been transmitted
in such a way, just because it shows all sorts of blunders not easily
committed by a trained oral tradition. Ι would rather think that it
was written down a long time before it was translated.

It can hardly be doubted that the Franks knew the art of writing
before their conversion to the Christian saith. Venautius Fortunatus
(Carm. vn. 18) found the practice of Runic writing amongst them
at the end of the 6th century (²). From the Runic writing holding
its ground among the Christian Franks at so late a period, we
may safely conclude that their foresathers practised it still more in
the preceding two or three centurieS.

As a mere guess, 1 advance the opinion that the title of the
Frankish law-book, whether in Runic or Latin characterS‚ was
rilalberg, i. e. Forum, a title not hals so strange as Gra'gak, or even
as Saclzsempiegel. Since malberg properly means “forum‚ ” it is
readily explained how the Spanish laws came to be called Fueros,
this being probably the literal rendering of some Gothic word iden-
tical or synonymous with the Frank malberg.

The so· -called glosses are, in my opinion, quotations from the
Frank Fuero, and were intended as a guarantee for the substantia]
correctness of the translation and to supply its formal deficiencieS.
At any rate they are no glosses in the common sense of the word,
though for convenience sake we may call them by that name.

ᾗ 5. Returning from the attractive but dangerous region of
speculation to the level plain of sober factS, I wish to make some
general remarks to which 1 shall be obliged to refer from time to
time while discussing the various readings of the glosses.

The mistakes of the copyists in reading their original are so
frequent, and, so to say, regular, that, for our purpose, it will suffice
to adduce a few examples of the most common errore. The letters
most apt to be confused, and consequently misread, are: t and c,

(²) Cf. what J. F. G. Schlegel, in his commenta-y on the (ἔτ-1333 (ἰ 3),
remarks on the Ieelandic law: “ Leges autem illae Ulflioti non promulgationis
tempore in scripturam redigebantur, sed ore prolatae memoriae commenda-
bantur. Litteris enim duobus paene seculis serius Islandi leges suas demum
mandari curarunt.”

The r has now and then been confused with ες e. g. fora,
XXXII, § 5 in 6, josa in 10.

This confusion of similar letters is observable in the Latin text as
well as in the glosseS. Another trait common to both is what may be
termed graphical cockneyism. The scribes were not in the habit of
pronouncing the h, whether additive or genuine. Now, we frequently
perceive that in the same codex 3ηά in the same word an initia] h
is either written or dropt or expressed by ch, according to caprice.
E.g. in Tit. XXXVIII, cod. 6 has in § 3 chamis-to (read changz'sto),
but immediately afterwards azisto (read hungis-ton in Tit. LXIV
we meet with cher, her, er. Similar instances abound. The easiest
way to account for this fact is by assuming that the Franks pro-
nounced the Ιι in the same manner as all other Teutons do to this day,
and that the ch was only a clumsy device to represent that sound
already lost in the Romanic tongues of the period. Gradually the
ch came to be pronounced as a k, and transmitted as such in the
French, but only in bookish words. Thus Hluwis was written
Chlovis and afterwards CloviS‚ a form which in reality never existed
in the mouth of the people, as is proved by the French LouiS, which

could never have arisen from Clovis, and is only explicable when we
suppose that the Franks said HluwiS.

Although the cb occasionally denotes an h, it must at the same
time have served as a sign for the Scotch, Dutch, and German ch,
but only at the end of a syllable, as e. g. in sichte and sochte
(Tit. XXIX, in 10). Where ch as an initial interchanges with g,
it must be regarded as an inaccurate manner of writing‚ or a rough
pronunciation of the g. It is known that the g has preserved in
Dutch and Low-German a sound which is easily confused with that

of the cho) by the people themselves, and with that of the h by
foreigners who have no strong Ιι iu their own language.

 

 

(²) It has more than once struck me that a Greek of my acquaintance

pronounced the γ, in well· known cases, like a Dutch ck, though the usual
sou nd coi nei 'des with the Dutch g.
