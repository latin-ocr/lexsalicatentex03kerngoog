NOTES.

The latter part of alachtaco in 2 is a derivative from tahan,
M. D. taken, Ο. N. taka. to take. In O. Ν. the neuter subst. ἰαὶ
means seizure; the femin. taka also “tenure of land.'' Taso is
either some case os a strong sem.‚ essentially answering to Ο. Ν.
taka, a taking, tenure, or the nomin. c. of a weak masc. in the sense
os ‘⁶ one who takes ”5 supposing, of course, that the final vowel be
genuine.

For alcata alchatheocus uz‘alaclna in cod‘. 6 we must read eliath <or
aliam) alr-h-ateoclms (or abiis) malatina. The last, more or less
Latinized, term signifies ‘⁶ obstructio itineris, viae,’' as will be
shown presently. It governs a word in the genit. case, a derivative
from ateochan (attekan), A. S. ateon, iter facere, meare, which does
not differ much from the simplex teon, meare, migrare (sor examples
see Grein, Gloss. i. vv.). A teochus <= ate-ochas) may be the geu. c.
of a masc. stem in a, but it is doubtful whether such derivatives
from verbs with radica] u occur in the sense of an agent, though
various other strong verbs yield nomina agenti.»⁸ in a, as well asin ja
and an. Yet, whatever may have been the exact form of the suffix,
1 think that aleb-afeochus or aleb-ateocha'zlr (the latter a stem in ja)
means “qui meat in villam,” or “meatus in villam.” Aliam =
Goth. alja), aliorsum (¹), or aliam (Goth. αζίαν), from the same base
iu the same manner as O.H.G. dara, thither, combined with meodian,
expresses the notion of ‘⁸ migrare,” just as the Goth. aljap asteipan
iu St. Mark 12, 1, translates the Greek ἀποδημεῖν. Ale’atha (aliam)
alc-h-ateoch then is ‘⁶ in aliam villam migrans '’ or “ migratio.”
Cf. Tit. XLV.

Undoubtedly allied to the term in 6 are those we meet with in 7, 8,
9, and 10. Both faeti and faci admit of an explanation and come
to the same thing, because A. S. facian, aseccan, geseccean, acqui-
rere, O. Fris. saca (²), to hold, catch, coincides in meaning with
O. Fris. satia, to lay hold os; A. S. fatian, setz'an, to setch, wis
fitc'an, uxorem ducere (s, Ettm. Lex. 333 and 337). The only
reason which induces me to prefer satis is that by doing so we get a
word synonymous both with ateohan and taco, because fatian, like
Skr. dpadyate, abhzspazzvate, is “to corne, to enter upon, obtain.'’

The existence of Ο. Η. G. gevazi, commeatuS, tends to confirm
the conclusion arrived at. Consequently 1 would read the term in
10 alac(l1)fati¹s uialatz‘na ,· alachsatir is the genit. os a masc. alach-
fati, stem -satia, formed like Goth. fauramapleis, wt'todafasteeir, or
of a neuter in ja, like Goth. fauramapli. Upon the former suppo-
sition alachfatz's would be ·‘ in villam meantis, villam capessent-is ”3
on the latter: “in villam meatus, villae usucapionis ” ; in either
case the governing word is nc'czlatc'na. In 7, 8, 9, we must read
alag- or alackfaethitls· (pron. faetjzlr).

ᾇ 88. As regards uia latina, it is only here and there that the true
reading with t has been preserved, viz. Tit. XXXI, where the cod.
Vossianus has uiae laciniae (³), and cod. 0 ᾇ 2 (prima manu), latina,-
otherwise the codd. show almost everywhere a c. Now, lucina has
no meaning at all, and uia lagina, i. e. “ way-laying,’' does not suit,

 

(²) Cf. sama), ὁμόσε.
(²) In the passage LL. Fris. p. 36: ‘⁶ and rna. hine befereth ur thersamda

' bernde,'’faca expresses the same as satia, as is proved hythe parallel passage

427 : ‘⁶ jes hi mit fatcbnderbernte biginsen wirt.’' Richthofen, however, gives
another explanation.

(⁸) The same error occurs in a quite different word in Lex Ripuar. Tit. 71
(Ducange i. v. lucina) : ‘¹ De quacunque causa fistuca intercesserit, lact‘na in·
tei-dicatur se cum sacramento idoneare.” The term intended is lustina,
0. Fris. latke, lade, A. S. Md, ladung, exculpatio; cf. Schmid, Ges. d.
Angels. p. 620. Either crathim: or “ se curn sacramento idoneare” appears to
be a gloss. · ⁸

TIT. XIV.

because there is no question of way-laying. Latini, latine, stem
late'm‘a', the Gothic form of which would be lateins, is the nom.
action. of latiari, Ο. S. lenekin, D. letten, impedire, Goth. lagjan,
χρονίζειν, ἕαίαζιὶιη, &ndat-rur, etc. Hence uz‘cze latini, viae impe-
ditio, is what in Ο. Fris. is called weimerr'nga‚ marring the way, and
also weekckettinge and mein-endem, the latter having the same suffix
as latini. The whole term has been Latinized to such an extent
that the genuine Frankish pronunciation os the first part os the
compound cannot be determined. lt is pretty certain that it is not
represented by nia or uiae, for the reason stated in ᾗ 6 of
the preliminary notes; probably the Franks said ποιέω, wega, or
wei-latini (latine). It must be observed that the term has passed
into the texts; hence its alteration, which afterwards reacted upon
the sio-called gloss.

ἦ 89. Thutp is a well-known Teutonic word. Itis not clear from
the text of the Lex whether we have to understand by it a village,
A. S., S.. and Ο. Fris. Porp, villa, vicus, Dutch dorp, or a farm,
Goth. pomp, ἁγρόςς and in a linguistical respect this is a matter of
indifference. Faltln'o is, apparently, a derivative from sallat: and we
would have expected either sarthe'o or fandeo, scithia. Both would
suit, for thurp-fizrtlub has its counterpart in Ο. Fris. hassa-re, huis-
ferd, A. S. missam, domus (mansionis) invasio; thurpfandeo, -sa‘tln'o
is O. Fris. kemslkin ge, lilmsbkm'nge, A. S. hcintso‘cn, Ο. N. lteimso‘kn
(cs. Schmid, Ges. d. Ang. p. 600) in so far as A. S. sandian, Ο. S.
saudan, inquirere, tentare, M. D. vanden, visitare, invisere aegrum,
N. H. G. falmden, etc., may be considered to express nearly the
same as sdkian. As, however, such a compound with sande'an ( san-
don) is found in no Teutonic tongue, it is safer to read sat-thio, which
is some oblique case ossarthi, fardc‘, or the nomin. os a derivative
from a denominative verb sardon ; cs. O. H. G. anasartdn, M. D.
aemaerden, N. D. aanvaarden.

The approximately correct readings os the gloss will be: thurp-
plzardeo, thurpephardc0‚ in 63 alachfarthio and thurpafarthio in
10; alafartlu'o and thurrepfarthio in 7, 8, 9. In the strange-
looking alasalmo os 8, the m is, as elsewhere, e. g. in mammodo
for thammodo (Tit. ΙΙ), a misread th, aster which the i has been
dropped by inadvertence os the scribe. Apart from the similar-Ity,
in sound and form, os rt and lt, there may have been another
cause why French scribes would be tempted to replace rt by lt,
viz„ a certain tendency of the French language which appears,
e. g. in auberge, alberge, instead of hariberge ,· heraud (herald) sor
leat-ard (¹). It must be owned that the r has passed into l in
auberge and kemut under circumstances not exactly the same; the
examples adduced only prove that the change shows itself in con·
nexion with a tendency to dissimilation, as in Italian albero ‚· in so sar
the alteration osthurpsardeo into thurpfaldeo would be accounted for,
but not that osalaclzsardio. Cs. the Notes on filtortelr, Tit. XLVII.

ᾇ 90. However this may be, there is little doubt that the peculiarities
oi the decidedly French-coloured semi-Latin of the Lex, have, to a
considerable extent, altered the shape os the Frankish words in the
Malberg too. We have an instance in ᾗ 2· of cod. 2, where the final
um in sriomurdum is due to the Gallo-romanie manner os pro-
nouncing um like 0, or nearly so. The word meant is hriomurdo.
In 6 we should read hreomurdo and chreunzurdio ,· in 7, 8, 9
chriomordio ,· in 10 ckreomordo. Clario, hren, is the well-known

(²) This word is generally derived from han'wald, as if the commander of
an army and the herald were convertible ideas. It would seem much more
Egtuzlrztzadgive herald from O. H. G. karen, etc., whence the word sorpmeco,
