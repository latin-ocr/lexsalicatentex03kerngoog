the second by all the other codd. Whatever may be the cause os
the discrepancy‚ this much is obvious, that terms so essentially
different cannot have been derived from one and the same source.

On comparing the two Malbergs lauxmada, lausmata and musci
sinnada, mscimada in 1 and 2, we perceive that, due allowance
made for clerica] euers, the latter part of both glosses consists of
scimada, scimatha. Iu this we recognise O. N. skimuor, a he-goat.
The a where the O.N. word has u makes no difficulty, because even
in Ο. N. u'Sr alternates with οὖν, e. g. in bautaur = bautuffr
(s. Egils. Lex. Poet. i. v.). Scimada is most probably a plural,
just like the corresponding terms in the other codd., as we shall see
below. The gender and case of scimada are uncertain. Difficult is
lau, which Ι dare not identisy with M. D. louw, a catch, a grasp (¹).
As the letters l aud f are easily confused in some MSS.. Ι guess that
the original reading must have been fau scimada, a few goats3 fau
would exactly answer to Goth. faws, saus, A. S. seawa, etc.

A flock of more than three (goats) is apparently called mu or ro
(scimada). It is easy enough to identify mu (sor mult) with O. N.
mtc'gr, a crowd, but nothing is gained by such a comparison,
because we want to find out some reading that may have produced
both mu in 1 and ro in 2. Asu may be a mistaken thu, which does
not agree with ro unless we put both readings together, and read
thr-iu, ebrio, i.'e. three, O. H. G. ἀνίει, tria ; εἰν-ἑο, tres, nomin. pl.
fem. ; dn'o, trium.

ξ 46. The second group of MSS. showS, as has been remarked
above, quite different tenus, In the first place afr-es iu 10 (note),
afrae in 6, haper- in 7, aper iu 8, 9. We have to read: hafres,
haphres, being the plural of hafr, A. S. hoefr, O. N. hafr, a
he-goat. The ending es is but a variation os us (cf. Tit. XXXII),
Ο. S. os, A. S. as. Another form of the same ending may be con-
tained in lamp-hebrus of 10, lamp-hebrus, of 6. Lamp-hebr is,
literally, a lamb-goat, i. e. a young goat, answering to the word
‘⁴ capritus ” in the Lex Emend. (cf. the Ο. S. compounds kb-sm‘n, a
sow, and bier-suin, a boar, in Heyne, Kl. D.). The e in hebr (pron.
laeevr) may be explained as a dialectic variation‚ which, it must be
owned‚ makes a strange appearance immediately after the a of the
preceding gloss. To remove the difficulty we may suppose that
hebr stands for hebri, habri, and that it is a neuter formed like
O. S. ποτ’, a lamb, in Gl. Prud. 740. In this case helam, hebro-
and not hebrus, hebrus—would be the plural, analogous to such A S.
neuter plurals as getimbru, getimbro. A further consequence would
be that in 6 we should have to read lamphebru smala. Smala
is the plural, both masc. and neuter, of the adjective smal, small.

ᾇ 47. For pecti in 6, pectis· in 10, I would read geete* or greiti, the
gen. sing. of ’ἕσας Ο. Η. G. gaiz, O. N. geitr, Goth. gaits, etc.
The final sin 10 is rather archaic; we may compare such O. S.
genitives as custes, giburdies in the Heliand. The isolated lamp in
10 is an error os some sort.

§ 48. A flock os more than three goats is termed chrenecruda in 10.
This compound may be analysed into chrene = A. S. hroen, capre·
olus (Ettm. Lex. p. 502) and crdda,akin to A. S. crdd, E. crowd, and
A. S. (lind)cr0da aud gecrod (cf. Grein, Gl. i. v.); further to Slav.
Russian gruda, grudie, a crowd, multitude. For chenecrudo in 6,
Ι would read chrmecrudo ,· for chanchurda in 7, 9, and the mutilated
chanchus in 8, either chram'curda or chrancruda. 1f the a os chran
be a long one, which cannot with certainty be inferred from A. S.

hrum, it would have its counterpart in the Ο. ΒΛ sor ἐ as occasion·

ᾇ 49. The term hadardi, leodardi, which we here meet with for
the first time, answers to M. L. G. luidweerde and Ο. F ris, liud-
werdene, liodwerdene, which in the Fris. LL. technically denotes a
certain kind of delicts and further a certain fixed fine to be paid;
e. g. there wive hiri liodwerdene mith 12 merkon to fellande (LL.'
Fris, 77, 3) ; or: jefter een man word worpen in een onwad wetter,
soe schilma him beta mit eenre lio'edwirden (ibid. 463, 7). The Latin
gloss to luydwerdene (p. 388. 18 ibid.)is: ‘⁴ hoc est secundum poe-
nam limitatam et taxatam a Frisonibus et est summa 8 librarum.'’
Synonymous with it is urjdd, i. e. an indemnity. In my opinion
the same notion of ‘⁴ indemnity” is also contained in the term cine-
werdum'a or cinewerdun‘a in the Lex Ripuaria. The i in cine is
the Umlaut of u ,· thus cine stands for cuni, A. S. cyrae, etc. As
cuni is a synonym of liudi, the Ο. Fris. liudwerdene and the
Ripuar. F rankish cinewerdum'a come to one and the same, at least
in their general meaning. Werdum'a answers to O. Fris, wer-dene,
whereas werduria shows the same form as Ο. H. G. wiroria (cf.
Graff, Spr. I, 638 i. v. wirdira). The usual Latin rendering is
⁴⁴ delatura ” (cf. Grimm, Pres. LXXXVII). Closely connected
is M. D. waerder, arrha, arrhabo, and warande, indemnitas, satis·
datio (S. Kil. i. vv.). Werd, werdene, werdum'a, etc., are deriva-
tives from a verb the O. N. form os which is veroa, and more usually
varon, ⁴⁴ to wan-ant, guarantee, bail,” and ‘⁴ to be finable, punish.
able '’ (cf. Oxs. Dict. i. v. varfia and veroa, B) (¹).

Leodardi (for madar-di, leodwardi) denotes, analogously to
O. Fris. liodwerdene, a fixed amount, viz. of 600d., to be paid for
certain offences, The elision or rather assimilation of w finds its
counterpart in Ο. H. G. frammart, frammert sorframwart ,· bin-
tert, widarert (cs. Grimm, D. G. ΙΙΙ, 98) ; Μ. D. in proper nouus
as Ludtg for Ludwig ,· Reinald for Regr'nwald ; Ο. Fris. onderdia
sor ondwardia; in O. N. and E. examples abound.

As to the declension, leodardi, leodard points to a sem. stem in
ia, or id. Here and there we come across a form leodardo in 8.
This too may be explained if we compare such A. S. seminines as
hyldo, ltaelo, menigo and the like. In O. S. we find words of the
same class rarely treated in that way-3 yet memgro occurs Heliand 1,
7 instead of the more usual memJg‘z' ,· strengiu 133, 1. The common
ending of such words in Ο. S. is i and so too in Frankish, for leo-
dardo is extremely rare, and may represent an oblique case.

ξ 50. Sejgusius, etc„ is a Latinized Frank. sagusi, scusi. It is
Ο. H. G. siusi, sz'uso (Graff, Spr. VI, 282), M. D. sies, M. H. G. sense,
sas, “a hound.” The word ‘⁴ magister’' is an ill chosen expression sor
‘⁴ doctuS,” and has given rise to a curious misunderstanding in 10.
As “magistrum'’ was pronounced, and sometimes also carelessly
written, magis-tra, the author os this cod. took this magis-tro for a
dative and added the word su0, by which the sense has been wholly
perverted. This alteration of the original text in 10, and in fact,
the whole Title, shows that, with the exception of the oldest texts, 1
