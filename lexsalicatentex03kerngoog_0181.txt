NOTES.

nitum ” (¹). Consequently, they must, not unlikely, have found in
their source a term, either char-ag itself or a word synonymous with
it, which admitted of a double interpretation. This much may be
held as certain that the original text at any rate contained a word
for hair (or tuss) or hairy (or wearing a tuft).

Basing ourselves upon this result we may proceed to discuss the
meaning of samiisfitlt. For fitlt we have to read sritla or firtlt,
a word known from Tit. XVII. We may render it by “damage,
injury ”3 cf. A. S. mid unforedan ἅδε, “ pleno iuramento ” in
will. H, 3. The translators confused the word with suffia, i. e.
satisfaction, as we see from ᾗ 5 below. Their error, which is quite
intelligible in a case like this, proves that they read fn'th or perhaps
fredo, i. e. O. Fris. frotha, not Ο. Fris. stethu. Virtually both
words amount to the same, and thus leode of 2 is perfectly right.
Famiis must be a genitive and bears the distinctive mark of it.
The only difficulty lies in the radical syllable. Aided by the Malb.
in 7-10 we see that the word intended is faxidi· (nl-sahsffl'), the
genit. sing. masc. of saxi, crinitus», an adjective derived from
fax, A. S. feax, sax, O. S. and O. Η. G. fahs, Ο. Fris. fax, a tuft
of hair, and the mass of hair falling mane-like down at both sides of
'the head3 less accurately used for the head-hair in general. The
slight variations in the meaning ofsaks must date from time imme-
morial, for we may trace the same back to the Skr. puk-ska and
kefapaksha. This is not the place to enlarge upon the otber-
wise attractive topics of the prominent part played by the ceremonies
of shearing or shaving the hairtuft of boys, of their wearing the
pah-51¹⁰, (kakapakska,) the fahs, and kindred subjects. Suffice it to
hint at the connexion between the “ pueri criniti ’' of the Franks and
the kakapakshadhams of the Indians, in order to impress upon the
reader that we have here to do with customs dating from the re-
motest antiquity, which, under the influence of modifying circum·
stances, became so altered that the idea underlying the symbolism
of the custom was no longer recognised. It is not the task of the
philologer to make out what faxi implies. It may mean either
“ one who by right of birth is allowed to wear long hair ” in con-
tradistinction to slaves and serfs, or ‘⁸ one who has attained the age
in which boys, especially of the warrior classes, wear locks.” The
latter interpretation is the more probable of the tw0, both on
account of the common meaning of paksha kakapaksha, and kaka-
pakshadham with the IndianS, and of the tenor of the Latin text
in the oldest codices. An adjective faxi, crinitus, would be regu-
larly derived with possessive suffix i from fax, like e. g. A. S. sl&
(stem suut), Goth. sleips from Goth. skipa ; Ο. Η. G. rami, spacious‚
from ram, space, etc.

ᾖ 126. The term for “ femina ingenua ” is leodini, leudim', formed
with femin. suffix nid from leodi, leudi, the Latinized plural of which,
Leudes—it is well known—may be rendered by ‘⁴ homines, cive8,”
answering to M. H. G. and M. D. mannen. Leudim‘a is as regular
an accusative as a genitive.

Leodomm'i in 2 is meaningless.. Leodam‘e or leode leodam’a would
suit. Sunii may be a misplaced faxiis.

ξ 127. A ‘⁴ femina ingenua et gravida ” is called adnouaddo, ano·
noddo, in 23 annouuano in 6, etc. Leode in 2 must be dismissed at
once 3 the true reading is leodim'cz, as preserved in 7-9, a reading cor·

(²) The absurdity of the distinction and addition in the later texts need not
be pointed out. According to them it is all the same whether one kills a
“hakul” or a “not haired” boy. Why then mention them at all? The

argiro texts are not much better3 in them, too, the distinction made is
nu ry.

TIT. XXIV.

roborated by “ ingenua ’⁹ in 2. By comparing the Malb. of 2, etc.‚
with facts known from elsewhere, 1 have arrived at the conclusion ·
that the approximately correct readings are as follow : and0ca[n]ddo
along with a variant anoca[n]dd0 leodinia in 2 3 ann-ocum or dia-
lect. annoucano in 63 anocano or anoucano (leodim‘a) in 7—93 ano-
cano leudinia in 10. And-acan = ann-dcun, anbcan, is, except the
immaterial difference of preposition, A. S. ea'cen, gravida, prae-
gnans3 for examples s. Grein, Gloss. i. v. It is properly a past
participle. The present participle of a cognate verb is used in
A. S. in the same sense, in edcm‘ende wis, mulier praegnans, Exod.
21, 223 the corresponding F rankish form is dcnandio, in the accus.
also bcnandio (¹) assimilated to &mad-‘103 the Ο. S. form would
show bcnandae'a, bcnandie, or -da, -de, It is by no means impossible
that under the various readings of the Malb. a third variation, viz.
A. S. geea‘cnod (Elene 341), gravidata, is hidden3 the Frank. would
be (andwcnado, etc. A participle is Ο. S. gibcana, impraegnatam,
in Heliand 9, 10: ‘⁸ sagda them siu welda, that sia habde gio-
cana, thes alowaldon craft, helag son himile.” An adjective is
acan, like Frank. anacan, in the same poem 6, 11: “ward thiu
quan (quena) bean, idis an ira eldiu.”

Although we know that in ancient MSS. ci can scarcely be dis-
tinguished from a u (²), it will be worth while to show that the Latin
text in the very next paragraph bears traces of being partially based
upon Frank. words which contained a c. Before endeavouring to
make good my assertion I have to observe that at one time the
Franks must have had the two verbs canicm, canm'an, A. S.
cennan, O. S. kenm‘an, Ο. H. G. chenm'an, the one signifying
‘⁸ gignere, producere,” Skr. janayati, etc. 3 the other ‘⁴ to acknow-
ledge, to know, to note, name, cognominare,” Ο. N. benna, etc.
Let us now look at the Latin text.

In the oldest codd. we find two cases mentioned, viz. of a child
‘⁴ in utero matriS,” and “ antequod (quam) nomen habeat.” The
younger MSS. add “ intra (infra) novem noctes.” The words
“antequam nomen habeat ” point to and (ant)· cond ‚· ant also
meaning “usque ad, until,” and cand being the past partic. of
cannam (cf. bicanda in Frank. Ps. 55, 103 70, 15 ; becoendon 73, 5,
Ο. H. G. chanta, N. H. G. karante, gekannt)3 the supposed variant
an(t)cand0, i. e. ‘⁸ conceptum ” or “ generatum,” scil. barn, was
interpreted as if the word were no compound3 cf. A. S. oncennan,
parere, etc.‚ Ettm. Lex. 406. Not far from this hypothetical
audeando (anna, autc.) stands the gloss anneando of 2. It is
difficult to decide whether the necessary c, both in the former
Malb. and bere, had already passed into a u or e. The appearance of
the rather strange addition, “ infra novem noctes,” in 6, 5, and the
Lex Emend., suggests the idea that the corrupt neuu, noua, is at
any rate anterior to the text of the said MSS. such as we have
them. For the addition is the product of a wrong interpretation 3
neuuando, dial. nouwando, is “the ninth,’' or a substantive ne-
uucmd‚ O. N. niund, a nonad, or a period of nine dayS. And
mando “usque ad uenam? in the meaning of the amplificr and
reviser, was translated by ‘⁶ infra (inu-a) novem noctes.”

It is, of course, impossible to make out what the original Salic
Law had or intended. Most likely, however, the word “ new-
born,” which everybody would expect in this place, was not absent.
Arm is so extremely like niu, πίω, κά, that it would seem far from

δονακῆα, hemula, would seem to be more regular. ,
