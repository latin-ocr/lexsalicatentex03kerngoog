NOTES. TITT. XXIV. XXV.

col. 96, and the still further corrupted instrinxerit, Tit. XX
(XXIII), ᾗ ι of cod. 10. The cockney h being mistaken by some
copyist for the genuine h, it was changed into clu· in cod. 3. In
:mala leudi we see smala, a genit. or dat. femin. aster the declension
of the substantives. Leda· in 7, 8, 9 is another pronunciation of
leodi ‚· such an ἐ, very common in modern Saxon dialects, was not

wholly unknown to Ο. S. ς leff for leof, lios, lies, occurs Heliand,
82, ²43 150, 18. Schala in 7 should have been corrected into
vnala, or rather smalcha, as 8 haS, and as it ought to stand in 9
also. Smalecha, smalcha is properly a diminutive of maala, formed
like O. H. G. wipihha ‘⁴ foemina,” properly ‘⁴ femella,” a female.

ᾖ 130. As to nuchala in 101 suppose the true reading is ium-hala or
iuclaeala, i. e. a form standing to M. D. angeling, a young woman,
maiden, much in the same relation as Lat. iuvenca to French
ybuvencelle (¹); the mascul. counterpart, Frank. jungelzjg· in Ps. 67,
28; O. H. G. jungeling, A. S. geongling, etc.‚ is well known.

In 10 §§ 7 and 8 must have been supplied from another source,
because the spelling leodinia with eo instead of eu is against the

custom of the codex.

XXV.

ἦ 131. For siuaemhen in 1 read thium· (i. e. thiwe) rbsen, the
ravishing a girl. Rcifen, the Goth. form of which would be rau-
bons, is a femin. stem in ἱᾶ, and the nom. action. of r6f0n, ravon,
rovon, A. S. reafian, Ο. Fris. rdvia, rdva, D. manen, etc.‚ rapere.
Substantially the same is theurora, read theoreifa, in 103 likewise
thuan-eubano, the word intended in 9 ; in 7 we ought to read thaus-
romana, the final a in the cod. being a mere mistake arising from
the 0 and um being sounded alike in the semi-Latin of the period.
The loss of the initial t, a wrongly spelt tlt, is occasioned by the
similar-ity of the characters ci and u ; we have already met with
many instances of the same error, the last in anacam, etc.‚ in the
preceding Title; cf. the notes on ahelepte and abazym in Tit. III.
The ou we know to be a dialectic variety of oo ; it is the usual one
in the Frank. Ps„ e. g. rouvas, rapinae, Ps. 61, 11 ς gerouvt', 67,
13. In uueruanathe of 6 the head has been put at the tai13 the
word meant is, of course, thmuerovana (or -rvuvana). For uirtu-
ane in 2 tkiuirvvane (or rofane) is required; uirtu looks so very
much like Latin that the ignorant copyist could not help improving
upon his original.

ξ 132. Fredolau'o in 6, hythe side of the more or less varying forms
of the other codd„ signifying ‘⁸ fornication‚ concubinage,” are deriva-
tives partly with the femin. suffix ia, partly with ina, from fredelas,
fn‘ozaf, fn'lafi expanded into firilas, manifestly the Ο. Fris.
fm'udeff, srudles, frudeff, amasius3 closely akin to O. N. sn'm'll, a

lover; ffisslajn'lla, aconcubine; Ο. H. G. friudel, friudol, fredel, ·

fn'del, amasim fhilila, amica; fiiudalin, sn'udalinna‚ concubina.
Consequently the approximately correct forms will be firilafflo in
2 ; fredolafio in 6; friolafia in 10 ; fn‘lafina in 7—9.

ᾗ 133. malos-zm is ‘⁶ the beguiling, seducing of a girl, servant
girl ’³ (²). Losina is substantially A. S. ledwng, E. lem-ing, Frank.
losong, dolus (Ps. 37, 13), Ο. N. laus-ung, etc. The quantity of the o

is not clear; if it be short, the word is formed like Frank. and O. S. “

lugina, D. leugm, lagen, mendacium ; Frank. cir-agina, dolus, Gl.

 

(²) young is etymologically Lat. iuvencus, Skr. muca, and in so far already
a diminutiv03 but in sense it has become identical with Lat. iuvenis, which in

its turn is an amplified iuven, Skr. yuwan.
(¹) This must be gathered from the text ; for in composition the themes tham,
a male servant, and thero-732, a female servant, have become alike.

Ta

L. 210. If on the other hand the vowel be a long one, the suffixis
m'ei ,· cf. such nominatives as Ο. Fris. dipem, etc.‚ against Goth.
daupeins (¹). An interesting dialectic variety is shown by theolasina
in 6. Both long and short 0, i. e. Goth. au and o, Goth. u, very fre-
quently pass into ἀ and a in sundry Saxon dialectS, especially in
those spoken on the borders of Franks and Saxons, in Twente‚
formerly in Zutphen, Cleves, Geldern, Jiilich, and thereabout.
Even in the classical Heliand we come across gibaran for giboran,
C. 25, 103 thalon for tholon, C. 95, 103 bam M. 53, 5 = bom C.

For the frequent occurrence of a and ά instead of o and σο in the ·

Saxon of the F reckenhorst document, cf. Heyne, Laut-und
Flexionslehre, p. 46. The same dial. a or ά recurs in amusim,
read thuuilasina in ιο. Eualesina in 8 we should correct to
theuulesina ,· the e or ἐ represents the Umlaut of 0 or oo, better
written ω, as it is not likely that such an Umlaut was pronounced in
another manner than it is at present in the Frankish and most Saxon
dialects, or in M. H. G. and M. D. It is just possible that e is an
innovation ol the scribes, who, being in the habit of replacing even
a Latin oe by e (²), saw no harm in doing the same for the F rank.
In Latin documents of the Frank kings we repeatedly find names
of well-known places in the Netherlands containing the oe (spelt eu
in D.) written with i, e. g. Lis-idun, now-a-days Leusden. In short,
a real e or i, sounded as such, in cases where the Umlaut of 0 or oo
is required, would be an anachronism in any ancient Frankish,
Saxon, or High-German dialect. In A. S. and Frisian the case is
quite different, of course. Theulasina in 10 wants no further com-
ment; it shows the usual orthography of the cod„ and is therefore
genuine. The reverse is the case with theolasina uuirtico, which has
been added from another source, the same from which 6 is derived.
The common source was already troubled: the term required is
ambligo or uverlrgo, in substance O. H. G. ubarligida, adulterium ς
from ubarlzgan, stuprare. Perhaps we should replace uvirlngdo at
once ς yet a femin. subst. uvirlzgo for um'rlzgrb, be it a nomin. or an
oblique case, is admissible upon the analogy of giba or hilpa and
such-like formations. Ikeolasina, the seducing a girl, and uvir-lego
fornication, adultery, are, of course, two distinct words and ought to
have been separated, or else connected by ‘⁶ or.”

ᾖ 134. Babmundo in 2 and bathmom'o in 6 do not agree. To re-
store the harmony between them we have to read bah for hab, and bach
for bath. The ending of the word reminds us of O. Fris. nedmund,
which means “ violence ’³ as well as “ violation, ravishing.” Here
and in sundry other words mund is not the well known Teutonic
mund, manus, tutela, but a suffix corresponding to Latin mentum.
Nedmund is a derivative from the Goth. naaman, ἀναγκάζειν,
nuffar, just as e. g. Lat. blandimentum from blandiri, testamen-
tum from testan'. With the same suffix is formed Ο. H. G. hliu-
mund, N. H. G. leumund. Closely allied is the suffix mum‘, e. g.
in Goth. lauhmum', lauhmoni, lightning3 essentially the same as
Lat. monium, e. g. in vadimonium, testimonium. A third suffix of
the same family is Lat. mnia, Goth. sni,· e. g. calumnia and Goth.
wundufni, wound (³); while a fourth of the same family is Skr.

 

 

(²) It is moreover by no means necessary that lesina should here represent a

mlssmffffid a striking example in the very same MSS., namely, mechatus

and mahat-n for moechatus.
(⁸) Tine variatione in the quantity of the vowel are explained by a reference

to such forms as Skr. mana, Gr. μενος, Lat. mnus, Bactr. nuno in the partic.
medii3 and by the interchanging of Skr. mdn, nan, mn, ας. in deman,
naman. The alternating of forms with and without t is exemplified by ὀνόμα-
τος against Lat. nomime, Goth. namtas. etc.
