Kern has informed me that Holder's readings of this word are cor-
rect. The form anam-2112» occurs, however, elsewhere.

 

Many friends have assisted me in the work, but 1 owe special thanlrs
to Mr. T. V. Keenan, M.A., Assistant Librarian os Trinity College,
Dublin, for his patient reading of all the proof-sheets and sor many
valuable hints, and to Pros. Paul Meyer, of Paris, for occasional
verifications made for me in the Paris Library.

Pros- Kern readily responded to my invitation to give the present
edition the advantage os his long-continued study of the Frankish
elements in the Lex Salio-a. During the progress of the work 1 had
often occasion to consult him on obscure points, and seldom or
never consulted him in vain. Some of his explanations and obser-
vations, conveyed to me by letter, 1 have inserted in their proper

place.

A unat analysis of the discussions, which have been raised for cen-
turies past on matters connected with theLex Salika, would be too
lengthy a task for the scope of this work. In an English edition,
however, it will be necessary to state briefly the principa] points
which have been the subject of elaborate treatises in Germany,

France‚ Holland, διε. ·
The question as to whether the Latin texts of the Lex Salika,
which have come down to us, are original or a translation or trans-

lations from some Frankish original, has been treated by Kern in

his prelimiuary remarks. Whether the original Frankish Law-book
was ever reduced to writing, or merely retained in, and handed
down to posterity from, the memory of some persons charged with
the preservation of the Law, cannot now be ascertained. Notis it
certain when and where the translations were made or the necessi·
ties for the original arose. We can only say that the Latin transla-
tions were not made before Chlovis had extended his power as far
as the Loire, as iu tit. 47 the boundaries of the Frankish empire
(i. e. of the Latin Lex Salica) are stated to be the Carbonaria
silva (in Southern Belgium) and the Loire,

As regards the original Law-book, the short Prologue (11) says
that four men ‘⁶ in villis ρης ultra renum sunt . . . per tres mallos
convenienteS, omnes causarum origines sollicite discutiendo trac-
tanteS‚ iudicium decreverunt-’³ Here the Prologue must refer to a
period anterior to the emperor Julian, because in his time the Salian
Franks occupied the Batavian island and Toxandria. The longer
Prologue (I) agrees with the short one in the names os the villages‚
though it does not say that these places were situated beyond the
Rhine, Moreover, it supplements Prologue Π in that it states that
the Lex Salica was compiled while the Franks were still heathens.
A clue to the date of this Prologue is perhaps to be found in the
fact that some of the codices containing it speak of the Gens Fran-
corum as “ nuper ad catholicam fidem conversa,” though the
majority of the codd. have simply ‘⁸ ad catholicam fidem conversa.”

The Franks are not mentioned in history before circa A. D. 240:
‘⁸ (Aurelianus) apud Moguntiacum tribunus legionis sextae gallica-
nae Francos irruentes cum vagarentur per totam Galliam sic afflixit,
ut ccc ex his captos septingentis interemtis sub corona vendiderit ''
(Vopiscus V. Aureliani c. 7). The exact year of this event cannot
be fixed. The same author (c. 7) mentions a song sung by Aure-
lian’s soldiers marching against the Persians: ‘⁸ Mine- SarmataS,
mille Francos semel et semel occidimus, mille . . . Persas quaeri-
mua,” and we know that the Persian war commenced in 241 Α. D.
But the war lasted for some yearS, audit is not specified whether
the soldiers who sang this song were the first who marehed against
the Persians.

After this year we read of protracted struggles between Rome
and the Franks and other Teutonic nations along the whole course
of the Rhine, and of various invasions of Gaul and even of Spain by
the Franks, Alamanni, &c. (cf. Aurel. Victor, de Caes. 33 διο. ;
Eutrop. ix. 8. 21 &c., x. 33 Zosimus, Ι. 30. 68; Treb. Pollio, Gal-
lieni, Postumus, Saloninus διο. ; Greg. Turon. 13 OrosiuS‚ vii. 22
διο. ; Vopisc. Ptob. 11. 13. 5, Tac. 3. 43 Nemesian. carm. venat. 67
sqq. ;Nazar. Paneg. 17). Franks‘occupied the Batavian island about
288 under the Menapier Carausius (Eumen. in Constantia. 5), but
were defeated by MaximianuS, who transported a great number of
them into the depopulated regions of the Nervii and Treviri as
Laeti (Eumen. 21). The island was cleared of all (Ρ) the Franks by
Constantius Chlorus (Eumen. in Constantium 8, in Constantin. 5
&c. ; Mamert. Paneg. Ι. 7). But they re-appeared in other placeS,
and, with the aid of other German tribes (Nazar. Paneg. 18), con·
tinued the struggle with Rome. (Cf. Richter, Annalen der Deut-
schen Gesch. Ι, where the details are worked out).

Not before the year 358 do we hear of the Saliari FraukS. They had
penetrated as far as Toxiandria (mod. Tessender-zoo, the country to
the South and West ofthe Lower Mense), where they were subdued
by Julian : ‘⁶ Caesar (i. e. Julianus) . . . petit primos omnium FrancOS,
eos videlicet quos consuetudo Salios appellavit, ausos olim in ro-
mano solo apud Toxiandriam locum habitacula sibi figere praeli-
center ” (Ammian. Marcell. xvii. 8). Julian himself speaks os
