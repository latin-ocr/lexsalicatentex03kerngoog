NOTES. TIT. 111.

(Hel. 5, 8) ; D. tril = dril (cf. Kil. i. v. dn'el) ; Northumbr. trago,
trag = A. S. dragan, drag (S. Bouterwek, Vier Evangelien, Gloss.
i. v.); D. troffel = thrufla (in Gl. Prud. 299), thrembil, and
drembil, toga (both in Gl. Prud. 204 and 670).

ξ 38. Higherin value is a bull “qui gregem regit,” called cherecheto
in 10, chan'ocito in 2, char-obitum in 1, aritkeocto iri 6. Cherecheto,
the reading of 10, is the only one admissible3 the other forms are
corrupt, though decidedly more ancient and readily admitting of
reconstruction into chariochito, chamht'to, haricheettO. Checo
(heeto) is O. H. G. hez'zo, N. H. G. hetin, M. D. hcet in sculdhefzo,
schaltheim, schaltheet, whereas cheetto (for cheetio) answers to
O. H. G. heizzo (kazkzo, haizeo) in sculthaize0; s. Graff, Spr. IV,
1090. That both chito and chbtz'o are admissible we may infer
from a similar double form in Goth„ viz. fauragagga and faura-
gaggy'a. Char-io, bario is the stem of the widely used Teutonic
word, Goth. harjis, stem hatja. The compound consequently
signifies ‘⁸ a commander of the troop.” The same form of the
stem charia is also found in the Batavian Chariovalda, the “dux
Batavorum ” according to TacituS‚ Ann. 2, 11. This word shows
exactly the same formation as A. S. heretoga, calwealda, Bret-
walda, etc„ and the Frank. chariocheeto, or O.' H. G. sculdheaw.
Har-i is, of course, a later form thau harim· still later is chere,
which already shows the Umlaut. chito may be a legitimate
variety of chetio, just as chito.

ᾗ 39. The next Malbe'rg is strikingly similar tc, and at the same time
provokingly different from, the former. In 2 we have chamacln'to,
in 1 chammitum, in 6 amz'tlzeoto, in 10 chananaeum, in 7 and 9
cltegmeneteo, in 8 chegmeneceo. It will not be doubted that these
words loo! as if they were the same as that applied to a “taurus
rex” in 6 (curiously: ‘⁴ taurus regis ” in 10), viz. anteoth, chamu-
theuo, On the other hand, as a ‘⁴ taurus rex '⁹ is virtually the same
as a “ taurus qui gregem regit,'’ it follows that chan'ocheetto and
chama-heuto, or whatever the correct form may be, must be syno-
nymous termS. Still the difference between the readingS, how-
ever slight, is too great to allow us to regard them as mere varieties
of one and the same original reading. In endeavouring to deter-
mine the meaning of this compound, chamaclu'to, it ,will be
convenient to consider first the prior clement chama-. D.
hamme (ham), dial. Flemish am, as well as hammenk means
“ pratum, pascuum ;’' hamme van wilgen “ salicetum :” see Kil. i. v.
As it means an inclosure in general, it nearly coincides with D.
hem, heim, A. S. ham, Goth. haims (in St. Mark, 5, 14 = ἀγρός),
so nearly, indeed, that in some cases it is difficult to avoid identify·
ing the two wordS. The O. Fris». hemmm’ke, himrik, hamreke,
etc. (s. Richth. i. v.), though not decisive, goes far to give us the
impression that both hdm (D. neem) and ham, hem (D. ham),
were used almost promiscuously, although the Flemish ‘⁸ hammerik,’'
pratum, clearly shows ham, not luem: cf. also Heyne in D. Wort.
i. v. hamm. From the different Prologues to the Lex Salica we
lea'rn that chaem (i. e. heem) or hem alternates in the names of
villages with ham, whereas a Malberg in Tit. XLII (q. ν.) shows
that ham was also used by the Franks in the sense of court, king’s
court; in some parts of the Netherlands, especially in the Betuwe,
ham is even now a common name for ancient mansionS, such as in
mediaeval Latin were termed curtes. Synonymous with hem,
heim, and ham, but radically different from the former, is another
M. D. heim, heiming, ἐφίετε, septum, the common D. form of which
is keining (for hegining), enclosure3 omhez'nem to fence3 O. N.
hugi, a pasture, etc. An older form of this heim (for hegime) we
have in chegme of 7, 8, 9. We may now proceed to the second

4⁵1

part of the compound. chito in 2 is obviously the same as the
erroneous cito of the same codex in chana-ito,- chito was developed
from chetio. In 1 one syllable has been lost; the final tum is a bad
spelling for to, owingto um being sounded oin the semi-Latin of
the Lex. We may conjecturally read chammt‘hz‘toe Neteo (in 7—9) is
an error for hete0; the same confusion between Ιι and n we have dis-
covered in the sa'me codd. in cabima instead of ganimo; s. above,
ᾗ 26. Both ckamachito (1) and chegmehiteo have the meaning of

‘⁸ commander of 'the pasture.” Quite a different word is theuto,
the0t0, in 10 and 6, which can only be a nom. ag. of A. S. pedtan,

O. N. pjdta, Ο. H. G. dzbzan, stridere, strepere, ululare. Grimm -

(Pref. XXI) takes it in the sense of bellowing, and compares it
with Ο. N. bauli, tauru5‚ baula, vacca, from baula, mugire. The
explanation looks plausible enough, but is only partly correct, it
would seem, for theutan might as well be taken in the sense of
“calling loud” (cs. Goth. puthaurn, σάλπιγξ), so that theuto is
“ he who caHS, gives the signal.” In fact, hecto is properly the
“callen’' cf. A. S. beokdta and baldea-alla in Exodus, 252 (ed.
Grein). Moreover it must be observed that the Skr. word which
radically corresponds to theuto, viz. toda, means “the inciter, the
pusher on,'’ and that the idea of motion, pushing‚ appears no less
in Ο. N. deta, to rush (s, Oxf. Dict. i. v.) than in Skr. tudati and
tundate (s, Pet. Dict. i. v. tud). Whether in the N. H. G. hagen,
dial. haagel, hez’gil, tauruS, we should understand the “inciter,’'
toda, or some derivative from hagz', so that hagen would contain the
same idea as the Frank. chamicheeto, I must leave undecided, and
rather refer the reader to Heyne's interesting remarks in Grimm’s
Wtb. 4, 15¹·

1 have said above that the Malb. anteotho and chamutheuo in 6
and 10 is m. m. only a repetition of amitheoto and chamitheuto.
The approximately correct reading will be hamme-oto, chamitheuto,
i. e. “the bull of the pasture,” or, as6 puts it, “ taurus rex.” What
could have induced the authors of ιο and the Lex Emendata to
change the Latin term? 1 suspect that on finding in their texts
“taurum regem,” and not unlikely a variant “taurum gregis'’
besides, they changed the latter into “taurum regis ” because
they took cham to mean “ the king's court.'’ Happily the ancient
reading has been preserved in 6. And not only 6, but also 1 and 2,
prove that cham has no reference at all to the king or any posses-
sion of his.

ξ 40. In the Latin text is mentioned a bull which ‘⁶ de tres villas
communis vaccas tenet.” It is not easy to see why there should be
bulls keeping the eows of three villages or commons rather than of
two. This much is clear from the Malberg, that it contains not
even an allusion to three [villages]. 1 presume that trarpillius is
one of the numerous Frank. words which became Latinized and
passed into the Romance language of the country, and that it
really contains the noun of number three, but without any reference
to villages or commons. Spille is, up to our own time, the word sor
village-bull in 'the Veluwe and Drente; therefore, thrarpilli may be
literally “ a three-bull.” Thre (thri) is to be taken in the sense of
“ three years (at least) old.” The elliptical use of a cardinal noun
we know e. g. from O. N. pritugn which, as an adj„ means “ aged
thirty,'' or “having thirty oarS,” or “ measuring thirty”; S. sor
examples Oxf. Dict. i v. pritugr, and ef. hamarr. In the same
manner we find in Skr. dvi, two, used in dwidhdrwaha, an ox
which has been worked two years (Lilavati, 76, and Colebrooke's
Transl. p. 34). If a tbrespilli is a bull of three years and more, it

(¹) The quality of the vowel iu the second syllable is uncertain.
