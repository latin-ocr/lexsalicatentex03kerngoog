NOTES.

Sometimes we must leave it undecided whether a particular error
be one of commission or of omission. E. g. if we see written
alac for alag and alach (Tit. XIV), it is certain that the c is wrong,
but doubtful whether ch or g· was the letter intended, for both cb and
g are, in such a case, regularly interchangeable, and the scribes are
just as apt to leave out the h of ch, ph and th, as to confuse c and g.

The omission of Ιι in the compound letters ph, th and ch is as
common as its being wrongly added. Thus, 6-10 all have a wrong
tum), turp. Is it by way of compensation that cod. 6 gives
reipbus for rapu-r, e. g. Tit. XXXII, whereas in 9 we find rephus,
while its brother 7 and cousin 8 prefer reppus? (¹) ΤΙιεο, theu, i.e.
Gothic piws and piwi, were capr-iciously written with or without the
necessary Ιι. In Tit. LV, cod. 7 has creo, its brother 9 creba, its
cousin 8 chreo ,· in C111 instead of chr-en, as 10 really shoWS, cod. 1
gives cren, 2 creo.

It must be observed that the use of the digraphs pt and ct to
represent the sounds pbt (ft) and cht (ht) cannot be considered
erroneouS. It is a peculiar way of spelling, of frequent occurrence
in F rankish charterS, Old English documentS, and, as regards pt, in
Icelandic. The frequency of this manner of writing‚ far'from point-
ing to a pronunciation different from ft and cht, proves on the
contrary that the Teutonic people using it were unable to sound a
real pt or ct. For those who cannot pronounce pt and ct, there is
no inconvenience in writing them, because it is a matter of course
that everybody sounds them according to the idiom. Ι have been
told by Mr. Henry Sweet‚ that Icelanders, up to this day, have a
difficulty in pronouncing pt, so that if they have to pronounce an
English word like accept, they naturally say accefl. There is no
doubt that this trait was formerly common to all people of the
Teutonic race. Hence (as an example of ct) the Ο. Ε. sohte, Engl.
sougbt, Dutch nocht ,· and (as an example of pt) Dutch kocht,
instead of the still dialectic kost, from koopen, A. S. cea'pz'an, διε.

Nor should we call it an error when, in all cases where Old
Saxon works, as the Heliand or Frank charters of the same period,
promiscuously use b (ὃ), s and v, we perceive in Frankish words a
fluctuation between b, v, s or ph. Even in the Latin text we
find examples of those letters having the same value, of course
under certain circumstances. Not to go further than Tit. 11, we
see how the Latin scrofa is expressed by scr-ova and scruva in 23
scrofa and scropha in 6 ; scr-oba in 1 ς scrova in 5 and 10. Sacrivus
in 6, 7, 8, 9, is written sacribus and sacri-'fus in 2; sacr-{sus in 10.
These examples, taken at random, will suffice to prove that the
Latin v(²) had,-in some regions at least, acquired the sound which
it has retained in French and Italian, i. e. a sound regularly passing
into that of s, under certain conditions; e. g. Latin noua has
becor'ne in F rench neuve, whereas novus yielded neus.

Wherever we see a v in Frank words alternating with f (ph)
and b, we may be sure that it was sounded like the letter v in
English and Dutch, and most likely in Old and Middle High
German. To express the w, the normal spelling appears to have
been uu, as in uuala, a Walloon, in 2, Tit. XLI. It is difficult to
say whether the Franks pronounced their w(uu) in the English or

 

 

(¹) In the particular case of 6, the ph instead of p is so frequent, almost
constant, that it would seem as if the copyist of 6 had been influenced by the
High-Frankish pronunciation. At the same time it must be observed that
cod. ro, though younger and in other respectu nearly allied to 6, regularly
writes p. A noteworthy exception is stafflus for stapplus in the text of
Tit. LV, though this exception may after all be an illusory one. .

(²) It is unnecessary to observe that u and v are not distinguished in the
MSS. For shortness sake 1 express by v tho consonant sound.

PRELIMINARY REMA RKS.

Dutch way ; the former supposition is the more probable. Instead
of uu we often meet with a single u, and that not merely in cases
where the Heliand also writes u. In Latin words uu (w) never
occurs ; the scribes very often turned the w into m.

The Latin of the text may be said to stand almost midway
between Latin properly so called and the French of the 9th century,
some characteristics of which are distinctly foreshadowed in the
language of the Lex. A few of these peculiaritieS, in so far as they
affect the exterior form of the glosses, deserve to be pointed out.
An initial s, if followed by a consonant, has a tendency to receive
before it an e or i; such an sis sometimes represented by x. E. g.
spoliare passed into expoliare ,· scrofa became iscrofa, Tit. 11, § 5 in
B, a MS. which belongs to the same family as codd. 7-9. Owing to
graphical cockneyism, the prefixed i is often spelt hi, in the same
manner as e. g. LIV, cod. 4, hoccisus for occis-us. This semi-Latin
e, i, lu· has not seldom, by mistake‚ found its way into the glosses.
Hence, in Tit. IX, excuto and scuto, both in one and the same
codex 2, by the side of hiso-hoto in 7, but scuto in 9. The varying
glosses extraho, iterabo and Itis-chmbo in Tit. XXX, clearly denote
one and the same word, the genuine form of which must have been
either scrabo (sehr-abo) or strabo.

It is another characteristic of semi-French Latin, that t and p
between vowels had already begun to be softened down to d and ὂς
ε. g. vodivo 11, ᾇ 11 in 4, instead of votivus. It is not to be
wondered at when the MSS., in which the semi-French character
appears most developed, do not leave the Frank words unimpaired.
Hence the erroneous rebus in XXXII, reibus, rebus in XLIV, for
which the Frankish text must have had repus, reszus. In the same
way, scopin (Dutch schepen), Latinized to scapinus, became sca-
binus, escabinus, &c., until it reached the modern French form
ecbevin.

A few cases remain where the origin of a false reading is open
to discussion. When we see in Tit. XXXVIII the word chanzisto
in 6, which is the O. Frisian hangst, Ο. Engl. hengest, δια, the
question arises how to account for the z. Though the original
sound was certainly g, it is far from impossible that before an i or
e it became palatalized as in Frisian, not to speak of languages
of more remote affinity. If gi in F rankish really had the tendency
to become zi, we should expect the examples to increase the
younger the words are in their general phonetic aspectS. But the
contrary happens3 the older form, in 6, is chanzi, the younger,
in 10, chengi. It is true that elsewhere to also writes in Zymtssr,
e.g. II, ἕ 8; on the other hand 2 and 10 have both tunginus where
we might expect tunzinus, and 8, though it has tumzimus, at the
same time as capriciously writes ingx'smus. If we remember that
in the so-called Anglo-Saxon (also Irish, Cymric) style(¹) of letters
the g, i.e. g, may be easily confounded with a, and observe how 10
strangely uses a capital in in Zymis, we shall be safe in ascribing
such a peculiar a to scribal ignorance.

Such confusions as are inexplicable 'from the style of writing
of our MSS. must date from a previous period. According to
Prof. Freund (²) the minuscule writing--that of our MSS.—goes
back to the end of the 8th and beginning of the 9th century,

⁵ so that the Lex Salica must have been exposed for nearly four
