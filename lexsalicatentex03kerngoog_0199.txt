Mustl'aest in 10 is obviously a clerical error; munker or murtam
would suit.

As regards pelag-m, peintus, pelargus, etc„ cf. Ducange, i. v.

ᾗ 213. Man'na, in phi-, pah-mrim of 6 and 10, sheds as much
light upon, as it receives from, Skr. upamdnrgna, the plunging,
immersi03 upamdmyati, to plunge (sce B. 8ι R. Dict.). It is a
nom. act. belonging to a supposed mnan, standing to Ο. N. mm,
to float under the surface of the water, to be water-logged, in the
relation of an active or causative to a neuter verb. phastio, stands,
1 suppose, for ri, sio, i.e. Ο. Η. G. sea, mare, lacus, stagnum,
lacuna3 the well-known word for sea in the Teutonic tongues. As
to the ι’, cf. lario for Ιινὸο ,· Μ. D. sie along with see ,· analogous is
M. D. suble, N. D. niel, Ο. S. siolo for stola. To account for the
error we must assume that the scribe of 6 or one of his predecessors
mistook the s fors, and being in the habit of spelling ph instead of

f, changed the latter accordingly. 1 confess that the occurrence of
p in 10 is not so readily explained. Yet an instance of an error in
the opposite direction, a p having been mistaken for s, is found in
ree’psus for reippus, Tit. XLIV, ᾗ 7 in codd. 9 and B.

ᾗ 214. Agoepha in 6 looks quite genuine. Whether the pk re·
presents a simple p, as is so osten the case in this MS„ or anf,
must be left undecided‚ and it is, to a certain extent, a matter of
indifference, because a discrepancy of this kind need not affect the
meaning in the maim cr. 0. s, apaan with A. s, apfan, M. n.
scop with E. scoff, and similar instances. Nor is it of any conse·
quence whether the oe represent oo, Goth au, or be the Umlaut of
it. A Frank. goop would answer to A. S. gedp, callidus, fallax3 cf.
gedplic, subdolus (s. (imin, Gloss. i. v. gea'p). A variation of the
same root shows itself in D. gluipen, to sneak; glmspsck, treacher-
ous, perfidious3 gluiperd, a sneaking fellow3 M. D. gluiper,
insidiator. A verb agvopian would therefore be apt to convey
the meaning of gulling, and betraying3 cf. A. S. aegype (Psalm

106) which, in my opinion, means ‘⁴ ridiculous.” How the notions
of deriding, scolding, and denunciating, of accusing, reprimanding,
are related is exemplified by A. S. gabbaa, defidere, illudere3 Ο. N.
gabba, to mock, make game of one, contrasted with Ο. Fris. gabbt‘a,
to denounce‚ accuse, prosecute; cf. also E. to chide.

The instances adduced will suffice to war-rant the conclusion that
the Frank. idiom was possessed of sundry words allied to A. S.
gzdp and its kin: a further inference is that the interpreter-s of the
law understood by agoepa or agvefa the ‘⁸ gulling ” οι· “betraying,
falsely denouncing one.” We may remark in passing that it looks
strange to find a delict of the kind mentioned in association with
other crimes of a totally different character. One would rather
expect in this 'risse some provision against strangling, stifling‚ and
since Ο. N. guupn means ‘⁶ a gripe, handful‚” M. H. G. goufe, the
hollow hand, pugillus ,· goufen, to clutch3 O. N. gmna, to encom-
pass; A. S. gedparr, to swallow3 it is by no means impossible that
the Malb. properly intended something different from what the
interpreters saw in it ς perhaps agvepa or agoaesa is the old, obsolete
term for what in the Fris. law is called sullengv, i. e. the seising
one by the throat with such a violence that one vomits‚ “ thettem
sin spise up etta muthe hlape ’⁹ (Fris. LL. 340, 21).

XLII.
ᾇ ²15· The notion inherent in the Latinized Frank. masa, msti,
5²7

is that of something valid, firm, trusty, strengthening‚ comforting3
cf. Goth. muru, a bond, truce3 O. H. G. trost, auxilium, solatium3
N. H. G. trost, D. most, consolation, comfort. Its A. S. equi·
valent, in almost every respect, is dagno, ἄκρας, strength, power,
valor, validity, a comfort, force and a force. It is a hond, as well
as a band. The Franks themselves attached to it preeminently the
notion of E. trus& this is evident from a passage in Marculf
(Roaiere, Recueil gen. des Formules, N o. viii.) ε “ Quia ille fidelis
noster in manu nostra tren-tem et fidelitatem nobis visus est coniu-
rasse, propterea decernimus ut ille in numero antrusoebnoewn (read
antrustionum) computetur.'’ Antrum'o is he who is in trust, more
especially in the king's trust3 he who is entrusted with a mission,
who is in office, be it military or civil, temporary or standing. The
Malbergs we shall have to treat of presently, show that to the
Franks the amr-asub was simply what we call in English an officer,
an official man ς in the case before us, a king’s officer, of course. The
ldng’s service is implied‚ not expressed. If we speak of ‘⁸ civil
service ” we mean, of course, Her Maiesty's, but the word service
or office by no means involves any necessary reference to the highest
authority. In order to express the notion of “royal ” the Franks
added ‘⁶ dominicus ”3 consequeutly an ‘⁴ anti-ustio dominicus '⁸ is a

· king’s, His Majesty’s, officer.

§216. Bismlio, battala, (thus we must read in 2, 8, 9),is the
nomin. of a masc. subst. of the weak declension‚ and formed like
Ο. S. ambulem. The easeagrees with the Latin “ antrustio domini·
cus.” The word is identical with Ο. H. G. pis-ballo, ὀίςτιίἱο,
vicarius, and essentially the same as A. S. sternuere, aulae prae-
fectus, oeconomus (s. Ettm. Lex. 732). Asthe notion of steadinees,
firmnaes, is inherent in A. S. stall, standing place, and statute,
just as in all words belonging to the mot sm, it is easily under-
stood how stal and trus-ti come to be the same, and ane, therefore,
interchangeable. Hence A. S. gesteaua in fflgestealla, limige-
snalla, commilito, expresses exactly the same as Ο. S. gibus-teo in
helmgitmsteo, a soldier, warrior. A hatstulfo is a person who is in
bis-tali, D. bestel, i. e. direction, administration, disposition3 cf. D.
besuam& dispositio, constitutio; conducti03 expeditio, apparatus
bellicus (see Kil. i. v.)-

Clramesaalt'a in 10 is apparently a dative of a neuter stem in ia ;
the neuter stuli stands to the weak masc. stolio in the same relation
as Goth. andbahti, ministerium, to Ο. 8. ammuh, qui habet minis·
terium, qui est in ministerio, minister. If the word be a neuter,
it must mean ‘⁸ office,” in which case the preposition an, in was
omitted ς an chamestalia would be analogous to ‘⁸ in truste domi·
nica.’' chame, cham, as we have seen in Tit. 111, is synonymons
with chin», a house, court, and with hage, hag, hegm, A. S. bugu,
gehaeg, Ο. H. G. hag, etc. (¹), and with Iros. He who is an chame-
stalia may be called chamas-mliv, synonymous with which is the
A. 8. hagosteald, boegsteald(cf.Grein, Gloss. i. v.,) 0. S. hagnamld,

hcmgastold etc. Chame'habia in 6' is simply a misread chame-etalio.
