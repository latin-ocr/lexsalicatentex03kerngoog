The text of this Famsly is usually called Lex reformata, Lex (a
Car-olo Magno) emendata. Two MSS. bear a date. In MS. No.
4626 of the Paris Library it is said at the end of the short Prologue
Placuit &c.: “Anno ab incarnatione D. N. I. C. DCCLX VIII,
indictione VI, dominus rex noster Carolus hunc libellum tractati
legis Salice scribere jussit.” In the St. Gallen MS. No, 728 we
find: “Anno ab incarnatione D. Ν. I. C. DCCLXX VIII india
tione sexta domnus Karolus rex Francorum inclitus hunc labelli
tractati Legis Salice scn'bere ordmavitss’ In two other MSS. (Paris.
Lat. 4628A and 4760) the indiction VI is mentioned without the
year. Of the above two years, 768 and 778, only the first agrees
with the indiction VI. F ormer editors (Du Tillet, Pithon, Bignon,
Baluze) of the Lex Emendata have the same notice, but with the
year DCCXCVIII (798). It seems that this year is not based on
the authority of any MS. An alteration of DCCLXVIII to 798
might be made if we knew that the MSS. in which the wrong date
occurs wrote90as it is donein some MSS. (0. gr. in 2, 7 and 9) of the
Lex Salica, namely LXL; but as the date of the MS. 4626 not only
agrees with the' indiction VI, but also belongs to the reign of Charle-
magne‚ it is not impossible that the year in the St. Gallen MS.is amere
mistake. As regards the operation effected‚ either in 768, or in 798,
if it means more than scn'here, and is the same as lucide (lucidius)
emendatum of the Prologue‚ it appears to have consisted 111 0111111-
nating the Malberg Glosses from the text, oorrecting the Latin,
omitting a certain number of paragraphs found in previous redac-
tionS, and admitting a few others. Charlemagne, however, does not
seem to have prohibited the use of the earlier redactions, as almost
an the MSS. of the preceding Families date from his time or astet
his reign.

In 803 Charlemagne again occupied himself with the laws of his
