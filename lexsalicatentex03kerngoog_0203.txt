NOTES. TITT. XLVI. XLVII.

spelling that we must assume both forms, with initial t and th, to be
equally correct. Η one os the two has passed into the other in
consequence of etymological adaptation—which is not impossible—
the change must, at any rate, have taken place long before there
can be question of a separate Salic law in contradistinction to
ancient Teutonic institutions in general. To make good this asser·
tion, it will be necessary to enter into a somewhat lengthy etymolo-
gical disquisition. ·

Tkungin is substantialiy the same word as Ο. Ν. perag-ill, a com-
mander; A. S. pengel, dominus, princeps; Ο. H. G. dwengil,
exactor. The suffix in is a mere variation of il, just as, sor instance,
Goth. himins, Ο. N. himinn, compared with Ο. S. and 0. H. G.
himil, N. H. G. himma, D. hemel ; similarly O. H. G. scefin,
scabinuS, along with eo-scefel, legislator. Whether we derive
thungr'n fi-om a verb thwingun (weak form thmJgan) or thingan
(thagura) is, in this particular instance, os no consequence: 1⁰ be-
cause the corresponding verbs in Skr., viz. masc (mac), tmanakti
and mac (tac), tanakti, to contract, are twin forms of one and the
same root; the same applies to the amplified maksh = taksh, to
suain, jein, with sundry derivativa, as takshaka, constrictor (a
snake) ς constructor3 a joiner3 makshas, strength; cf. Greek
τόξοις 2⁰ because in' the more limited sphere os the Teutonic
tongues there are abundant proofs of thung not differ-ing
from thmng. E. g., Ο. Η. G. ungadungam unrestrained, is
wholly = ungadwungan in ungadunganiu hir-aua, ingluvies; ca-
dhungani = gadwungani, angorg bz‘eiungan (ptffhungan, etc.), con-
strictus, oppressus: cf. Ο. N. pungr, heavy (cf. Graff, Spr. V, 272,
sqq.). The same is the case with A. S. gepungm, sober ς geJmn·
geulize, sobessy, in “ blrtse drincen we gei5ungenlice druncennisse
gastesss’ rendering ‘⁶ laeti bibamus sobrie ebrietatem spiritus.'' We
meet with gepungen in the sense of restrained, fun of restraint, e. g.
in- }›edwum gepungen, Judith 129, whereas in the same sense we
have Ο. S. githuungan (i. e. gzffhwungan), in Heliand 10, 4 (¹).
For more A. S. examples 1 refer to Grein's Gloss. i. v. gepingan,
only observing that, in my opinion, the lexicographer has not been
successful in his arrangement of the various meanings of gepungen.
He has even wholly misunderstood gepungon in Metra 1, 7:
‘⁶ Haesdan him gecynde cyningas twegen, Raedgot and Aleric, rice
gepungon‚’' i. e. “they had their own indigenous iringa, two (in
number), R. and A„ who governed the kingdom ” ς cf. Ο. Η. G.
dwingun, stringere, coercere, moderari, etc. 3 gadwingan, frenare,
coercere, constringere, opprimere, etc. (s. Graff, Spr. V, 269, sqq.).
Whether gepungon belongs to a verb gepa-ingan or gepingan is a
disputable point, but, as we have remarked above, the general
meaning is not affected by any doubt in this respect.

To resume, thuregin, penge! is in the first place ‘⁴ he who con-
strains, by whom consti-aiut is effected ”3 he is both the coactor

and the exactor. Synonymous with thungin is Ο. Η. G. sculdhezzo, ’

O. S. scultheto, Ο. Fris. skeltdta, M. D. schult-heet (Latinized
scultetus), schoutlteet (for scham-beet), praetor, praefectus praetorio,
iudex quaestionis, praesidens inter iudices ’⁹ (see Kil. i. v.). How
closely the 'ffunctions of the Frisian skeltdta agree with those of
the thungin appears from the numerous passages in the Frisian
Laws and the summa-ry of those functions as given by Richthofen

in his Gloss. i. v. skeltata. Properly scalt-hecto means in general “

“qui imperat debitum,’' and according as ‘⁴ debitum” was

(²) A. S. gethaeum, fit, perfect, developed, grave, is no less deducible from
the primitive notion of attaining, stretching, atr-ingingg it is the notion under·
lying the ideas of contractiori and extension-

understood in the wider acceptation os anything one should do, or
in the narrower one of ‘⁶ debt,” the scula-heere was considered to
be the magistrate who proclaimed and commanded (1) what was to
be done, proclaimed the judgment, or who enjoined the payment
of debts3 cf. Ο. H. G. sculdan, condemnare, and gasculdan,
gesculdon, and Grimm, R. A. 755.

Tungin, though apparently different from thungin in sound, and
most probablyin orig-in too, may be regarded as meaning the same,
viz. “he who constrains, coerces.” For on comparing the nume-
rous derivatives belonging to a verb tingan, Skr. danp, we observe
that thingan, Skr. tair'c, and tingan, Skr. danf, convey nearly the
same notion. Cf. e. g. O. H. G. sanga and swanga, A. S. tanga,
E. tongues, Skr. sandanfa, etc.; O. H. G. zangar, mordacium,
Skr. dama-tra, danslgtrd, dafana, a tooth; A. S. getenge, con·
nected, incumbent, oppressive, heavy, almost synonymous with
Ο. Η. G. gadwungan ,· A. S. getengan, to enjoin, attach; Ο. S.
bitengi, allied (Heliand 43, 11); oppressive (141, 13); O. N. turgia,
to join, connect; tengoir, bonds, affinity. These few instances
will suffice to show how easily tungin and thungin could have been
looked upon by the Franks themselves in the light os vicarious
forms, Let me add that tungin is supported by the Latinized
tangatur-e, clearly taken as “constringere ”3 further by A. S.
intinga = aebod, and by Ὀ. N. zyggl = tiggi, a chieftain (²). If
there is some confusion between tingan and thz‘ngan, tungin and
thungin, it must date from very remote times indeed, and 1 for one
would even doubt ‘whether such forms as N. H. G. swingen, where
we might expect dwingen (tm'ngen), may be called simple aberra-
tions.

We cannot doubt that rung-in can answer to Ο. N. aeggi, in
spite of the difference in their suffixes, if we remember that O.H.G.
scaffeo, scaffo, conditor, is substantiany the same as scefin, weak
form sceffenO, Frank. scapin (whence the semi-Latin scabinus),
scepeno (Ps. 67, 6), D. schepen. The suffix in is common to sundry
words belonging to the same category: Goth. kindins, a governor;
O. S. drohtt'n, etc„ a lord ς Frank. scapin, thungin and tungin.

change of r into Ι is the result of the Romance mouth being adverse
to the repetition of the sound r, hence 'cariberga becomes alberga,

to Μ. D. vertmkken, which sometimes means ‘⁴ producere.” Since
trukken is synonymous with A. S. tedban, whence is derived A. S.
tedm, appellatio, qiman, gettman, vocare ad warrantum (S. Schmid,
Gloss.), the conclusion is obvious that the substantivesfin‘orht and
