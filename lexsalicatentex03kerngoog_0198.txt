NOTES. TIT. XLI.

In fact, the whole tenor 01 11ιο Latin text gives me the impression that
the term fnbfenho, fiio-fuld, and perhaps frethfaltho, in linguistic
mpecoe, simply means “wantonness,” and further that fn‘ofal
originally contained the notion not only os lust, but also of petu-
12200, just as Goth. frib, D. vrek means⁸ ⁸,”greedy whereas A. S.
fitchNfrekrOHGfiech etc., ιιιε2221>0111“”ε10οἀγ and

9210. Uuasbuguinfi, uuarbucoin 7, etc„ is acompound, the
latter part of which is, apparently, bac, M. D. biauk, buik,⁸ ⁸trun-
cus corporis,” like Ο. N. Μὶν (¹). The ending is that of an in-
strum. 0, goverued by some preposition‚ say an, in, or even td, 12
the sense os“tovrards.” That “unuln'' is meant is clear from
the Latin ⁸‘homo sine manus et sine pedes? In was the interpre-
ters seem to have seen some word connected with Ο. H. G. ἀπεὶς-ι’,
acarcass; cf. Graff, Spr.1, 522 and 1077, where we find the quo-
tatiou: ‘iro irsbrgmin arcasin, occisa cadavera finem vulpes et
lupi.'’ Still nearerinsound stands M. H. G. θυαε-αἱ, which along with
the variations avesa, aba-rel, anwasel, men, etc., denotes a car·
cass, the body of a dead 221ι221ς1110 adject. dwesel 12ι ‘miserable,
poorly”; O. N. vesall, wretched, veslingr, 2 poor soul. An off-
shootfrom the same 21012120. N. vas, misery, 1011ς cf.,ve's toil.
Rememberiug that we have met with an a in ama-estha (Tit.
XXXIII) as a variation 01· e 12 ammon, we are tempted to derive
was or rods and amem, etc„ from the same source. By doing so
2νο shall understand how the interpretes-s os the law could see 12
wasbuc “a withered trunk'’ or “a bare trunk,” for Ο. N. vesall
osten means ‘⁸ destitute.” whether the interpretation is right cannot
now be ascertained. A certain amount of scepticism in such mat-
ters does no harm3 until an analogous example is adduced from other
Teutonic lam, it will be safest to assume that the whole paragraph
in the Lex is the result of etymology. My suspicion is all the
strouger because in the Frisiau Laws we repeatedly find the word
vase, A. S. and M. D. vase, dirt, mud, mire (cf. Ο. N. vetita, 2
pool, cess-pool), used in connexion with such delicts as are treated
01· in this Title of the Lex Salica. Thus Fris. LL. 95, immediately
after the wapuldepme, i. 0. the mahte of the Franks, we read:
‘⁸ Hwasa otherne werpth an wetir and an wasa”; at flius-werp
(442), 2 crime of the same kind as that specified in ξ 9 oscod. 1 ε
“ 11101 12 02 riucht fliuswerp, thet hi weth aud wasich sie.” In
combination with mpeldspene the Fris. Law contains provisions
against the crime called soldede, defined to be ⁸⁸ violenta percussio
prostrati ad terram postquam per se resurgere non potest '⁹ (p. 94).
That the soldede is very osten deadly appears from pp. 160 and 222 z
⁸⁸ Huersa ma en soldede deth, aldennithe dethma thcne haghesta
dadsuima.” Now, sol is synonymons with vase and it would be
far from impossible that mbae was properly a term deuoting the
same as soldede, i. e. ‘⁸ violenta percussio prosimu ad 1011212.”

The Malb. relating to the taking down 01· corpses from the gal-
lows 22111 be discussed at Tit. LXVII.

method because the least dependent upon preconceived 2011022-

0bdupli0 in 7, challzlr-ubduprb in 10, ebullis-solio in 6. Obduplt'a,

pelen, to submerge3 ob, ub, is Goth. us, under3 for duplica, 200
above ξ 204. Ubdupz’o in 10 is unobjectidnable, supported as it is
by A. S. djsppan, the Frank. equivalent of which must be dupr'an,
duppr‘an. Osedo stands for qfdo ‚⁰ do is radically the same word as in
selon do (¹) ; qfdo cannot differ much in meaning from Skr. milh-

volutare, Heliand 52, 8, 11ιο same word as A. S. ιγὶἰαπ, 10 soil, of
course, but 12 the passage of the Heliand it should be rendered by
volumre, as appears from the context: ⁸⁸ hwand siu it an horu
spus-nat, ,πιλίαᾱ an sande.’' Evcn more distinctly in the sense os
throwing down on the soil 2νο find O. Fris. u’lengt (sor orange) in
gers-silenge, which differs little from hor-mr? (²); cf. also sullozge
and wldede, Richth. Gloss. i. vv. In short, adsim not only means to
throw with soil, mud, but also to throvv on the soil, into the mud.
The word is entirely analogous to D. smg'jten ‘⁸ to ffing dovu,”

“to soi1,”⁸ ‘to smite,' Ἀ. S. smitan, percutere, but minag, pollu-
tio; Goth. 522, gri-mettim, ἔτιχρίειν, Ο. H.G. smlsan, linere:
mn, contaminare. That ,καὶαπ 2120 022 have meant more
particularly· ‘to 02220 10 slide,” may be deduced from D. sullas, to
slide.

There can be 2ο doubt that the translators 01· the law have
rightly caught the general meaning of ostio, obduph'a, etc„ as they
render it by ‘⁸ iactare '' or “impingere” Not so clear is their in·
ter-pretation os hali, etc. The word certainly has uo reference to
⁸⁸puteus.” From the tenor 01· the text in 7-10 2νο maygather that
the interpreters hesitated, and it behoves us to seewhetherthe cognate
languages afford us 2 0120 10 11ιο signification 01 significations os the

The fact 01· challis interchanging with 01102ᾰώ- 12 11ιο Malb. wanants

forms with ld answer to Ο. H. G. hald, clivus3 balda, praecipi-
