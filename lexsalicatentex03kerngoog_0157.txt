θ NoTEs. Trr. 11.

horsi, gemsi (Oxf. Dict. i. vv.). As to gemst', a dimin. form of
gemlingr, a year old sheep, it differs but little from the Frank.
gr'mzk, gimus, though the latter belongs to the strong declension‚
and in so far stands nearer to Icel. gymbr, Provincial [North] Eng-
lish gimmer. The constant variation in the final syllable which in
some codices is written us, in others· is, leads me to suppose that
the suffix, with due allowance for the difference in gender, is the
same as O. H. G. usi or isi in hazus, haris, haus, furia; gen. pl.
hazusso and hazisso (cf. Graff, Spr. IV. 1092). Thus we have
gimus, gimis, stem gimusi, gimisi, a yearling; like the Icel. ve-
trungr; mgimus, ingimis, ‘⁴ an animal one year (winter) old ”3
both tenus are occasionally somewhat loosely applied to a young
animal.

§ 14. Apparently akin to gr‘mzlr, gimuS, is hymnis in 7 and 8 ; him-
nes in 93 hinniin 6; ymnis-in 103 imnis· in 3. The initial ought to
be ch, more accurately, g. From the confusion between the two
values of ch (see ᾗ 5), arose the error of writing a single h, which
led to a second step in the wrong direction, viz„ the dropping of
the letter altogether. In the same way the word gamallus in Tit.
XLVII (4th sect.) also written chamallus, was corrupted first to ha.
mallus, and afterwards to arnallus, The formation os hymnis, etc., is
not clear, and indeed, the correct reading is doubtful. If chymm',
clu'mni, without final s, be genuine, the suffix may be the same as
O. N. ni in squnkm’r, a wolf (cf. Oxf. Dict.), and akin to the weak
ni in gra‘ni‚ a grey mare; mni, an ass; skjdni, a piebald horse.
If, on the other hand, chymnes (gymnas) be genuine,1 am at a loss
to account for it, except by assuming that the word is derived from
a stem himan, Gr. χειμών, Skr. heman, in the same manner as in
Skr. dryamrpa >from aryaman, but with the same suffix as we found
in gimir. With much more confidence we may affirm that hinni
in 6 is an error of the same kind as chranne for chramne, and
that we should read ckimm‘.

§ 15. Fikt in 6, fith in 10, fitin 3 contains a diminutive suffix t, found
also in E. rabbit, pewet, pewit, tinebit, and very likely also in colt;
in D. kz‘evr't, kreeft. From fill are derived the M. D. vigge and
veggen, a pig(¹) ; filet is another dimin. form of the same radical-
The transposition of ht into th in 10 (fitlae) is very common, almost
the mle, in that codex.

ᾇ 16. Synonymous with chimm'fiht must be tertega in 6, thmesun
in 10, thetica in 7, 8, theca in 9. This word is certainly connected
with the Latinized tenum, tertussu, tonossu διο. which we find in
§9. From the wording of the phrase “si quis porcello tertusu
imbulaverit usque ad anm'culum” it is clear that terta-m denotes a
porker not fully one year old. The fines specified do not agree,
indeed, as we have xv sol. in cod. 4 and the Sept. Caus, 1. 3, while
the other MSS. give merely 3 sol., but in the confused state of the
MSS. such a discrepancy is of little importance. We have seen
that in cod. 2 inzymus is identical with the “porcellus qui sine
” matre vivere possit,'’ while the same z'nzymus is the Malb. of
“ porcus anniculuS,” notwithstanding the difference in the fine
which in one place is 40, in the other 120, denarii. Therefore, no
obJection will be raised against our identifying tertusu of the text
with thertesun, δια, of the glosses, The Frank. su or sa may have
been of common· gender like the corresponding Latinsus and Gr. ὓς,
whereas the Bactrian hu occurs as a mascul„ and the Ο. Η. G. sd
as a feminine. Suu is either a contraction ofsuin or an error for suu,

i.e. sd. Herte is nearly the same as the M. D. der-tel, tenelluS,
delicatus, lascivus (cf. Kil. i. v.); denen, fastidiosus, petulans:
so likewise danten in the Teuthonista, which is explained by
vertar-dt. The D. d of these words is the dental, answering to E.
th3 still, it interchangeS‚ according to a rule not yet discovered, with
a t, just as in E. tangle compared with Icel. pb‘ngull. It is
interesting to note that M. D. tortelmoedrg (fastidiosuS, morosuS,
irritabilis) is a variation of dertelmoedtjg (cf. Kil. i. vv.), and that the
D. dwz'ngen (for thwingen, Ο. S. thwingan) has its counterpart in
N. H. G. zwingen, which, allowance made for the different degree
of Lautverschiebung, stands to the Sax. and D. word in the same
relation as E. tangle to Icel. pb'ngull. Quite the same applies to
Germ. zart compared with D. dartel. So too the Frank. therte =
Ο. Η. G. zart, tenellus; famae-t means “delicatus;” saner-tit,
verzertet, delicatus3 ephebus, puer. With Ο. H. G. jarzart or

sarzertit is to be compared the above mentioned vertardt of the

Teuthonista, while with Kiliaen’s tortelmoedzjg we may compare
Ο. H. G. zur-del, impatiens; delicatissimus In short, the Frank.
the-rte, therti must have had the meaning of “tenellus,” and the
various readings terte, ter-tu, tortu are more probably legitimate
variations than clerical errors. Theti in 7 and 8 is to be restored
to ther-ti. The final ga in 6, ca in 7, 8, 9 may be a mutilated galt,
as this would answer to sun and su, though a derivative ticet-erga
(= thertinga) would by no means be impossible. still the final a,
i. e. the sign of a femin. in this case, creates some doubt, because
a similar and synonymous word, namely the Ο. S. ferscung,
vet-scung, O. H. G. frisking, is always used as a masculine.

ἕ 17. The term for “ scrofa '’ is narethaltlzi in 1 ; narie-alti (read
nanjg‘alti) in 2; narechalte in 6; naret-halt in 3; uarachalt (read
narachalt) in 10. Gn'mm (Pres. XVII) aptly compares the Bavarian
nersau, ner-schwein, from neren, Frank *nar-thn, to seed, to breed.
Focichalta in 10, foczfale (read focichalt) in 6, must be synonymous
with nan'chalti; for focian is D. fokken, to breed; and fociclzalta
answers to D. fokzwzjn, a breeding SOW. That the fine for the
theft of a focichalta is higher than that for the theft of a narichalti
is probably caused by the addition ‘⁴ cum porceIIiS.” The stem of
chalti, chalta, chalt is chalcia (galtia), a femin. of the strong decl„
not to be confounded, either in form or in meaning, with the weak
O. H. G. galza, and Ο. Ν. gylta, a young sow.

ᾗ 18. Drache is a term applied to pigs of at least one year old,
and corresponds to the Latin “anniculuS, anniculatus,’· and “ post-
anniculatus.” Besides drache in 1 (ὗ 4) and 6 (§§ 12 δι 13), drace
(read drage or drache) in 2 (ἕξ 7 & 8), drac(}1)e-chalt in 10 (ᾗ 15),
we find draugein 3. The word seems to answer to hant-zugiling in
the fragment of the O.H. G. version. As A. S. drogon,- M.D.
dragen, E. to draw, is expressed in O. H. G. by ziuhan, from which
zugiling is derived, it is not unlikely that drage, dracke is syno-
nymous with zugt‘ling.

ᾗ 19. To ingymus, ingymzlr, which has been discussed in ᾗ 13, we
find added natariae in 6, ethatia in 10. Both readings are clearly cor-
rupt, perhaps from narichalte, nan-chalda, unduly repeated. Zymi·.
senguno in 10 (note) is likewise out of place, and belongs to the
next paragraph. For sengano we must read suegano, a variation of
soa ι.

ξζο. The rendering of ingymis by the Lat. “ bimus '’ is wrong, as
this would be in Frank. tuigymus or tugymis. It will be observed
that cod. 1 has no gloss for “bimus,'' and that 6 and 10 have the same
word for ‘⁴ anniculus ” and ‘⁸ bimu5,” which cannot be right. The
Ο. H. G. version has correctly zwzjdn' suin. Senio in 6, and the
misplaced sengano in 10, point to suenio and suegano as the
