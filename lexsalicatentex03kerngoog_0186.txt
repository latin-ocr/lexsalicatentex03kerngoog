balm, a hunting-park, in the Ο. H. G. wiltpan (Latinized ,wiltpan-
nus) in a charter ot* A. D. 1059 (¹) and in the Teutonic burgban,
N. H. G. burgbann, i. e. “termini civitatis ” (s. Graff‚ Spr. 111,
12 5). Ban, like its more modern substitute in German and Dutch,
gebiet, gebied, territory (from G. gebz‘eten, D. gebieden, to command),
properly means domain, imperium, dz'aen‘o ; hence French banlieue,
which in German may be rendered by burgbann, in Dutch by stad-
gebied. Bann by itself, in the sense of jurisdiction, territory,
frequently occurs in O. F ris., as may be seen in Richth. Gloss., i.v.
hon, ban. ·

ᾗ 144. In ξ 23 of 6 we unexpectedly come across the Malb. orbis
uia lazana, read latina. In Tit. XXII we have seen the meaning
of the term; here the question arises, is clausura a literal transla-
tion οἰ the Frank. sclusa ἓ If not, the translation is an inaccurate
one for ‘⁶ obstructing the road to or from one’s premises.’'

ᾗ 145. As gloss to “retem ad anguillas”we find in§ 19 of 1 ⁵

obtobbo, in 2 obtubbo. ob is Goth. uf, under; but Ι guess that for
tubae», cobbo, we must read crabbo, cobbo, because the D. (wok-abbe is
the very term for a weel (i.e. basket) for eels. In Icel. netkubbar,
arethe quills of a net. Now, the quill of a net is called in D.
dabber, with which the Malb. obduplo in 6, obdopus in 10, obdubas
in 7, obdubus in 9, obdub in 8 apparently shows some connexion.
Thus it may be said that the variety of the readings supports to a
certain extent the supposed cubbo (²). The grammatical form is
not clean the word shows either a genit. case of the singular of
the masc. or neuter gender, or a nomin. and accus. case of the
plural ot* a masculine. As to the mdical, cf. A. S. dyppan on the

one hand, and dasan, dfisan on the other, as well as D. dobberen,
to §flliigiatfe'remacss etc„ in ξ 2ο, is a diminutive, more or less
Latinized. The Frank. word must have differed buthlightly, is at
all, from the Drenthian (N. Saxon) treemke (sor tremike, tramiffi), a

trammel. Both the English and Drenthian word point to a simplex ,

trami or tramia.

§ 147. Uerteuolus in 1, uer-teueles (?) in 2, etc„ is another would·
be Latin ποιᾶς wal, wel answers to Ο. N. vdl, vael, an engine;
vael til at takafiska meu, an engine to catch fish with, a net (see
Oxs. Dict. i. v.); in substance E. veel. Τὶιε variant uer allows us
to identisy wer with O. N. ver, a fishing place, a were, D. weer
(vzssrchweer), Ο. S. or Frank. werr, wenstad in Crecelius' Ana-
lecta (3). Werte (met-th, werd) is very likely an amplified form of
πασῃ· it is rendered by ‘⁸ fluvius, flumen ” in 3- 10 and L. Em.

ἦ 148. Nascus, nas-dms, the word intended in 7—-10, looks as if
it were the genit. sing. of a masc. stem in u or wa. Nascon in ι
has the appearance os being the same case of a weak fem. nasca.
With the exception of the initial, nasca would be identical with
O. H. G. masca, a mesh, net ; while a masc. nasco would = O. N.
mb'skvi‚· naseu is the same word belonging to the strong declen-
sion. The initial n instead of m is strange, and at vai-lance with
the common Teutonic forms in which the word appears. Consider-
ing that naseu is justified, to a certain extent at least, by Skr.

 

(²) Graff. Spr. 111, 1253 cf. Benecke's M. H. G. Dict., ἰ.ν., 1, 86.

(²) On the other hand it may be urged that the interchange of tub and dub
has its analogy iu D. labbe = dobbe, E. tub; doppe = toppe, tup (cf. Kil. i. vv.) ;
as to pp alternating with bb, cf. D. topper«, labben, insanire (Germ. menn
labben, ioppen, crinibus apprehendere.

(⁸) Cf. Heyne, Kl. D.,200. Whether it is necessary to suppose,as Heyne does,
that a wcrr was made of stenes, is doubtful. In D. a weer is simply an en-
closed private fishing place.

Ι

akslzu, a net, snare, we have no sufficient reason to doubt the
unanimous testimony of the MSS. (¹). Nasde in 6 is a misread
mehe, which in its turn is an altered naschen or nasches.

Dinar in 1 and 2 is a puzzle to rne. As codd. 7- 10 have texacha,
then, instead, I scel tempted to read diufa (i.e. &insa = thiufa),
Ο. Η. G. dinsa, thiubu, etc. (S. Graff, Spr. V, 98), M. H. G. diebe,
theft. The only difficulty is that in 2 we never find the diphthong
expressed by iu but by eo.

ᾖ 149. Obdo in 1 and 6 stands„ by assimilation, for opdo, which
Ι regard as the 3rd pers. sing. preS. subj. of opdbn, Ο. S. uppdan‚
uppduan‚ N. H. G. auflhun, to open. For abdon in 10 read abdo
or obduo ε O. S. uppdua. ,

ξ 150. Screoer, scrom's (a bad spelling sor serame) is the genit.
of a neuter screonz', scruni, stem in ia, O. N. skygni, whereas
scr-eona is the same case of a femin. senona, screuna, Ο. H. G.
uagina, M. H. G. schinne, N. H. G. scheune (cs. Tit. XIII).
Streonas (read scr-eonas) in 10 likewise looks like a gen. sg. of a
sem. screona. Nasche sereonas antedi, as we find it in 10, is “ the
breaking open of a shed sor net3.’' Pronus anthim in cod. 2 is not
only a mistake for saronas antedzb, but misplaced, as is evident from
the various readingS. Probably the original reading in 2 was
opdo ,· nasce-seranus anthedio, in accordance with 1, 6, and 10.

§ 151. The Malb. hocherpa ande esm'ppas in 2 reminds us of
similar phrases in the Fn’s. LL. ; e. g. 237, 12 : “ HwaSa Others lond

· erth ande skerth,’' i. e. “ whosoever ploughs and shears (cutS,

reaps) another’s land ”3 396, 2: “Jef een man deth ureer ende
ovirsclzeer,” i. e. “ if a man does unlawful ploughing and unlawful
shearing (cutting, reaping).” Ur is avr-:2 ovir, here used in the
sense of transgressing, trespassing, like A. S. ofer. Another, but
later, expression for the same thing is rdf-erd and rtis-skerd ,· 489,
26: ‘⁸ Sohotsoe joe toe claghe kompt, se hit an raqui, se hit um
raefscllerdst’ '⁶

It is clear that the phrase in 2 cannot express “ campi alieni
aratio et seminatzb,” unless the reading be entirely corrupted.
Hoetu bears a false resemblance to Goth. hoba, a plough, as an
initial h does not occur in 2 unless-by way of cockneyism; (Inach-
erpa rather agrees with Northumb. ohtripp, messi0, St. Matth. 9,
383 St. Luke 10, 2. Very likely there existed in Frankish aword
ochtrzp, omn), but it is misplaced in the present Malb., and looks
as is it were a mere synonyrn of eser-ip, which is apparently a com·
pound os esc, Westphal. and Twentian esch, comfield‚ N.H.G. esch,
Goth. atis-ks (cf. Grimm, D. W. i. v.), and rip, genit. rippas for
rippias ,· ripp agrees with the Northumb. npp in ohtnspp, (h)n'ppes‚
St. Matth. 13, 39; (h)njppemonnum 30, alternating with (h)ripe.
The tautological character ofothripa(s) ande escnjppas is no slight
proof of the genuineness of the phrase; but it can by no means
belong to such a reading of the original text as we find translated
by “ campum alienum amre et semz'nare.” By a slight change we
get the word for ploughing, at least in 1, 7-9, is we take sor 1 :
averet-1²0 and reppa ,· for 7, 8, 9: obrerdu and appas. Ovempo,
etc„ is the genit. or dat. sing. of a femin. overerpa = OsFris,
uvrerthe, -erde, Reppus represents nsppes, with a dull vowel
sound in the ending, variously expressed by a, e, ἰ, in Ο. S. and
Frank. and in the Malb. also by u ,· rappes (reppus) = Northumb.
n'ppes,· reppa may also be a dat. sg. masc. or neuter. The three
words signify “ of (for) unlawsul ploughing and reaping.'' How
naturally the ideas of erian and ripun are connected is exemplified
